1,Anyone else with heart effects from COVID? (Unvaxed older female),https://www.medhelp.org/posts/COVID19/Anyone-else-with-heart-effects-from-COVID-Unvaxed-older-female/show/3075848,2023-03-03T18:05:19-05:00,Dizzytinestwo,"

          I was not vaccinated and got hit hard by Covid. I am a 60 year old female. After nearly 3 years of super cautious behavior, I wonder if the new very contagious strain is what got me.  At lunch I was fine and by dinner I had the worst headache of my life, couldn't eat, and temp reached 102 at 1 am, the next day going up to 102.7 Tested positive on rapid covid antigen test  I also felt like i had knife blades in my throat and my nose and throat were quite congested. I was nauseous and could not eat for a whole week. Urine output was minimal although i was drinking a fair amount of water. Temp fell and then rose again but not to as high a level. Remained feeling very ill and congested Noticed throughout my heart rate was elevated but i attributer that both to fever and dehydration. After a week i started eating but remained very congested. My pulse ox meter did not show any dip in oxygen saturation at fingertip. I was encouraged to go to ER for fluids but I did not go despite being close. I felt very sick.  Its now been two and a half weeks since covid onset and I've noticed something odd about my heart. First i saw on pulse oximeter that not only had it remained higher than usual, but it would speed up then slow down then speed up then slow down. It was not a stable rhythm. I used my kardia monitor  and also payed for membership to get the advanced feature of a graph of the R-R interval. It was highly variable and Was able to determine that this was a a sinus arrhythmia. So not a fib or flutter but varying rhythm . Docs have been frustrating on this. If you look this up, you'll find  it is fine if you are a kid but if you are older and get it as an adult, it usually signifies heart disease  i do not know if mine is respiratory or non- respiratory sinus arrhythmia but either way  in older adult indicates an underlying problem. Very frustrating to have a doc instead say “normal variant” despite this and despite never having it before.  Before covid i had Sjogrens Syndrome, dysautonomia, and a mast cell issue , so not in the best of health and knew i would get hit hard  Currently , besides heart (also 25 beats higher than normal) , temp still a degree higher than usual, lots of sinus pressure, anosmia, intense rib pain apparently  from a few coughing fits, Headaches, sleeping alot, eating alot, and i Don't feel back to my usual self yet. I assume too soon for long covid  Anyone else experience a heart change? And  still there 2.5 weeks past onset? It might be easy to miss this one if one weren't obsessively checking pulse ox meter. and noticed the odd jumping around was different than usual. Any  comments? Input would be helpful. Will i feel better? What about the body temp and headaches? Etc. Thanks for any help. I don't have enough stories to know  how typical or atypical my case was, especially from unvaccinated older people   Would be helpful to compare. Thanks

          I just missed a week of work due to testing positive for covid-19 I tested again and I'm still positive. I've been asymptomatic. I was trying to figure out how I'm going to make ends meet after missing one week of work. It looks like I'm going to have to miss 2 weeks of work now!  Is there not any assistance available when you're forced to not work from covid?

          https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/long-covid-now-looks-like-a-neurological-disease-helping-doctors-to-focus-treatments/?utm_source=pocket-newtabAs of February 2022, the syndrome was estimated to affect about 16 million adults in the U.S. and had forced between two million and four million Americans out of the workforce, many of whom have yet to return. Long COVID often arises in otherwise healthy young people, and it can follow even a mild initial infection. A meta-analysis of 41 studies conducted in 2021 concluded that worldwide, 43 percent of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 may develop long COVID, with about 30 percent—translating to approximately 30 million people—affected in the U.S. Some studies have offered more conservative numbers. A June 2022 survey reported by the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics found that among adults who had had COVID, one in five was experiencing long COVID three months later; the U.K. Office for National Statistics put the estimate at one in 10. Even if only a small share of infections result in long COVID, experts say, they will add up to millions more people affected—and potentially disabled.

          I'm a month removed from Covid. It started with an emergency room visit, They found blood and protein in my urine as I went in because I couldn't pee.One day later I developed upper respiratory Covid symptoms. Coincidence? Antibiotics cleared  up the infection as I retested two weeks later and all was clear. However I'm  now having to urinate constantly. I have test strips and no problems are showing up. Also my left flank hurts. Other than that I feel like I've recovered although I feel some dizziness here and there and brain fog.  I am a 68 year old male who was in great health before this infection got me. I had gotten 3 vaccine shots about a year ago but never bothered to get anymore. Has anyone any ideas what is going on with my urinating?

          My grandpa was already in ICU for a week,80 years old, double lung infection and some pulmonary fibrosis, assisted by Ventilator. Although other medical indicators get a little bit better, his doctor recommends doing a Tracheotomy. This is a very hard choice for families, and because China just released the Covid-19 restriction, we do not have any experience in treating Covid-19 patients, even the doctor does.  I really need help to know whether the Tracheotomy is a good choice. Truly thankful anyone helps. Need help!! whether to do a Tracheotomy for an ICU Covid-19 patient.

          I work in the Internet industry in the UK. I suffered from depression three years ago. I was basically cured before I was infected with the new crown in November 2021. I have stopped using antidepressants. But after being infected with the new crown, the depression relapsed again. The doctor judged that it was one of the symptoms of the new crown, brain fog, which continued. After getting the new crown, I felt that I was ""brain-dead"", I didn't want to do anything, and I felt extremely anxious. It started with cold-like symptoms, headache, cough, fever, and loss of taste and smell. Chest tightness, shortness of breath, fatigue, insomnia, loss of appetite, forgetfulness, difficulty concentrating, unresponsiveness, and anxiety also occur. The whole situation is not good. I lost four kilograms in weight. All four members of my family were infected with the new crown, one after another. I couldn’t live a normal life for about a month. Apart from feeling tired all the time, the two children recovered relatively quickly, but daily life such as food and clothing needed to be taken care of, and I felt that life was fragmented and messed up, and I couldn't cope at all. I remember that I had a cough for three weeks, was bedridden for a month, and then took a long sick leave for more than three months. I simply can't afford to get out of bed to cook, the kids eat takeout every day and they have mouth sores for a long time. Fortunately, there are friends who help and often send us home-made delicacies. At that time, volunteers from the community also sent me antidepressants to my home to ensure that I could take them in time. My family doctor advised me to ask a counselor again. The biggest push for me was a few home visits by the social worker in charge of child welfare. The well-intentioned help made me extremely anxious and insomnia. I felt that I was an incompetent mother who couldn't even do the most basic things to take care of my children. Does the new crown make me a useless person! This is unacceptable to me. The regular doctor's consultation and the kind greetings from the leaders of the unit also made me feel like a burden, and I didn't want to be sick all the time. This day-to-day burnout and bedriddenness made me feel worthless. For a long time, I thought I had Alzheimer's. I can't remember anything, and I look for things every day. What the doctor said has to be asked several times over and over again to understand. Sometimes after calling in the morning to confirm, call again in the afternoon and ask again. Later, when I was browsing the web, I noticed in longcovidcarecenter that my symptoms may belong to post covid brain fog, and I checked many papers here to confirm my guess. Sometimes I don't know if I have taken medicine or not. Going into the kitchen, I forgot what I was going to do. Looking at the pills with a glass of water, I asked myself if I just took the medicine or didn’t take it? Because of the confusion caused by many small things, I deeply doubted my ability to handle things. She feels that she must first learn to forgive herself and accept herself who is often tired and forgetful. Family doctors and psychologists believe that the new crown and its chain effects have become an inducement for the recurrence of depression, and the dose of antidepressants needs to be increased. It has been five months since the dose was increased, and the effect is obvious. She is recovering, but she still has symptoms of anxiety and fatigue, and her physical strength has not yet fully recovered. Now I want to start with doing one small thing every day, to be happier and stay optimistic. Doctors hope to gradually taper off the antidepressants over the course of a year.

          Hi everyone, I tested positive for Covid on Monday of this week having exhibited symptoms on Sunday but I was not testing positive until the following day. My wife and her sisters went on a vacation to Florida and brought it up with back with them.  I had a sore throat Sunday and Monday and that was about it. I did try paxlovid on Monday night and had to DC Tuesday am due to a horrible, horrible stomach ache and nausea. I also found out that it was contraindicated for many medications including one I was taking (doctor didn’t mention and had to contact about what to do) I was wondering a couple things. Is this usually how it goes for those who have it mild or does it progress further at this point and does anyone here deal with any anxiety and did this make your covid experience worse for you? It has not helped mine at all lol. Thank you for any and all answers. As a side note I am vaccinated and boosted x1 as it we want until recently they made a second booster available for my age group.

          Hello, I have been looking for answers for a long time. I had Covid last November. During the time I had it (12-14 days) I had shortness of breath, muscle aches all over, and loss of taste and smell. I’m sure I’m missing a few things! Ever since, I got pain in my neck, back, legs severely and genital pain.  In April I began to have stinging pain, which eventually covered my whole body. Now I have full blown peripheral neuropathy all over. Very bad pain in my legs and tailbone area, blurred vision, and my body vibrates uncontrollably. I’m 27 and was a bodybuilder until this started happening. I’ve had every single test done that doctors could think of. Every blood test, mri, xrays, cat scans, ct scans, emgs etc. they’re finding nothing. Has anyone had these symptoms? They can’t diagnose me.  If anyone knows anything I would greatly appreciate it.

          From the limited news I have heard about the worst-case Coronavirus symptoms, the lungs seem to fill with fluid making the ventilators not work effectively enough. Why not avoid aggravating the lungs by ""working with"" the symptoms by filling the lungs with high-Oxygen liquid? I had heard that Liquid Breathing is used in neonatal using PFOs. Otherwise, can we look at supersaturating water (or another common liquid) with Oxygen like we use in Agriculture (CO2Gro or Moleaer)? What am I missing, other than actual medical knowledge (a large gap in itself) with this as an option?

          I had a mild Covid infection in late Feb 2022. On day 5 I developed horrible psychosis, depression, physical and mental anxiety, burning sensation on the top of my head and heart and twitching muscles. It’s been 6 months now and symptoms have improved. I feel maybe 85-90% most days and the psychosis and depression is gone THANK GOD but I randomly get the burning sensation on my scalp that is always accompanied by a physical anxiety feeling in my core. Has anyone dealt with these symptoms post Covid? I’ve tried supplements for neurotransmitters, Omega 3s, Hyperbaric Oxygen, Acupuncture, CBD, Kava, GABA, l-theanine and St. John’s wort and breathing techniques. Hyperbaric oxygen was the most helpful but it’s inconvenient to do regularly. Would love to know if anyone has had success treating these symptoms with any other methods.

          I am 10 weeks post covid now with some breathing difficulties ( not sure of cause yet) seeing an ENT specialist and diagnosed rhinitus so far( inflammed nose-narrowed nasal passageways ) waiting for ct scan results for sinuses . Symptoms now are congested nose ,some headaches, runny nose after food/exercise (runny nose and post nasal drip have lessened due to nasal spray - dymista) some difficulty breathing on waking ,going to bed and occasionally on exercise. Fully fit and healthy before covid -no breathing probelms ever .Any suggestions as I am really worreid about my breathing ! I have tried resting more at times and sleeping sitting more upright, eating slowly to avoid breathlessness and nothing seems to stop these symptoms which vary a lot from hour to hour and day to day.I expected to recover from covid easily as I have never had any health problems at all in 51 years ( 3 covid vaccinations) no medical history of any other conditions and fit and healthy working out 6-7 days a week for the last 17.5 years working in the fitness industry.I presume my symptoms are linked to covid as I did not experience them before this.I need a  lot of help to get me through this - I do not want to be dismisse das just another case of rhinitus and left to suffer with a nasal spry when there is so much more involved in this .Any help /advice from personal /medical experience welcome thnak you!

          So it seems like one of the early symptoms of Coronavirus is digestive issues, mainly diarrhea, as per a few articles that came out today: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-digestive-symptoms-diarrhea-almost-half-of-patients/ I wanted to share this because about a month ago, I started to experience daily digestive issues and the main symptom was diarrhea. At first I thought it was something I ate, then I thought it was my medication no working due (I am a chronic hepatitis B patient) because when I was dealing with that virus when it became active, it was similar symptoms. Lack of appetite, odd fatigue & weird sleep patterns, weight loss and muscle wasting, diarrhea, etc. Anyway, I was going on for a month like this and that is how I felt, that some virus was attacking my system. It eventually slowed down to almost nothing today and this past week, and everything is sort of going back to normal (I do have a cough that has been around for a week, and a stuffed up nose, but these too are subsiding).  Anyway, I wanted to share this because all tests I took, nothing was able to be found with me. And it seems like this may be what I had... though doctor refused to give me a test because I was not presenting with chills & fever. I wanted to make everyone aware as it seems like the common symptoms are not the only ones. I'm planning to make a full recover at this time, within the next week.

29,Proper mask handling,https://www.medhelp.org/posts/COVID19/Proper-mask-handling/show/3071938,2022-07-01T20:44:49-04:00,JTPA,"

          If someone regularly wears a high quality mask but frequently handles the mask improperly - i.e., grabbing the front of the mask to pull it down in order to blow their nose, wipe their face, etc. - how harmful is that? Are they still generally safe given that they’re wearing a highly protective mask? Does repeatedly handling the “contaminated” part of the mask practically negate the purpose of wearing one? What if the person touches the mask with one hand and blows their nose with the other? I’d appreciate some clarity on this. Thank you.

          Hey all, so I’m based in India where over the past month or so, there has been an uptick in infections which is pointing to a new wave that’s underway. I managed to not catch COVID in first three waves (or maybe I didn’t show any symptoms, I dunno), but tested positive on June 13th. I went through 2-3 days of 101 F fever, general tiredness, but was fine shortly afterwards. There was a lingering scratchyness in the throat, coupled with a stuffy (not runny) nose for a few days, but that also is largely gone. I took a test today that showed I’m negative now. I checked my weight today and realised I had dropped a fairly significant amount this month. Going through my phone’s health app, I realised that I was at 118.4 kgs / 261 lbs on June 3rd which has now come down to 113 kgs / 249 lbs. Barring a few days, I have generally been eating a very low calorie and clean diet. Plus the last couple of days, have been eating slightly less since my stomach was upset. My questions: - Have folks with COVID experienced similar weight loss in a short time? - Is a 5.4 kg / 12 lbs drop over a 25 day period that overlapped with a 12 day COVID period normal for an (overweight) guy like me? Thanks in advance for your responses!

          My mother talked to a Covid-positive person without a mask. She said that it is fine because she is fully vaccinated. She won't catch it or it won't lead to serious illness.  However, I have acute asthma and don't wish to catch it.  I might develop serious illness despite being fully vaccinated.

          So I had covid in Dec., with symptoms for about 10 days.  Since then, I've had shortness of breath - I have good days and bad days with that. Some days, I can barely walk to the mailbox, others are much better. Fatigue is terrible, but insomnia is worse.  I have some digestive stuff, but I had that before, so I don't know if that's connected.  Doctors know nothing.  How is everyone else?

          I had covid over a year ago.  It was a nasty case of it and I had a second round of it a few months ago again.  Blah. I lost all smell and taste. It's since come back to some extent but isn't the same.  Things smell very weird, off, faint or not at all and lots of things taste really bad (like bug spray). So, I got something to try and wanted to know if anyone else has heard of this.  I listened to a radio program about it and it is retraining your smell. I purchased a smell training kit online.  Pretty cheap. But it has four scents and I'm supposed to expose myself to them for a few seconds twice a day. What exactly this will do, I have no idea.  ha.  I'm charting it.Lemon is very faint.  Rose is strange. Anyway, hoping this helps as it is being recommended by doctors for those who have long term loss of scent from covid 19

          Do we use up our vaccine antibodies each time we are exposed to covid? I ask this because I have recently been exposed to covid on a daily basis whilst caring for an elderly relative. I managed to stay negative for a whole week before eventually testing positive. Then I went down hill rapidly. There is no doubt I was exposed for days, because I had my relative practically coughing in my face for days. It felt as though my vaccine antibodies (last booster 4 months ago) were keeping the virus at bay until all my antibodies were used up and then I just caught it big time. In fact I was really quite ill. Worse than my elderly relative. The WHO has this to say about vaccine lifespan… “Immunity may reduce faster in people who are older or who have underlying medical conditions, or who have a high level of exposure to the virus” It is this last part that I find interesting and is quite important for carers who may be exposed to covid over an extended period.

          I am at the moment Covid-19 pos so I chose to post here however I don’t need to have covid for this to occur but for it to get as bad as I will talk about here I need to have a respiratory infection of some kind. I also have Sjögren’s syndrome which has me taking a steroid inhaler twice a day so I can breathe in the cold winter air. No asthma apparently but always get phlegm and coughy when I laugh hard or run a shorter distance.  I was picked up by an ambulance and brought to the emergency room earlier this week because it was hard to breathe. Basically I was panting because my body told me too and whenever I tried to slow down my breathing it feels like when you’re holding your breath. The ambulance and emergency room found my O2 saturation at 100% and my blood gas showed signs of hyperventilation. Now this doesn't and didn’t surprise me at all as I can feel that I am getting enough oxygen, as long as I am panting. The first time this happened during another infection I had pre-corona the emergency room all thought I was having a panic attack. That is absolutely not what is happening. I have had them in the past, they’re completely different and don’t last for 6-8 hours.  EKG was good. Blood gas good. As I managed to slow my breathing down more and more without feeling like I was going to suffocate my saturation sank and eventually the panting stopped completely and I had a saturation at 93-94%. According to the hospital staff, my saturation should still be bad even with the panting if that was the problem. I argue that my body obviously is panting for a reason. It’s basically very laborsome to fill my lungs.  Am I missing something here? Is my logic really not valid? And what words am I supposed to use to explain how I feel to avoid the panic attack label? And why would I suddenly feel shortness of breath if I have no trouble saturating? Thank you for reading this far. While I’m just thankful I don’t need medical help, I want to understand what I am going through.

          I was infected with covid in aug. 2020 and then again in dec 2021.  The first time I had covid, symptoms were very mild, brief sinus headache and congestion but also had mild difficulty taking deep breaths, it was a tightness in the chest.  All my symptoms were gone in a few days except for the chest tightness and that weird issue where sometimes taking a deep breath was hard.  It got better over the next year or so but recurred on occasion (maybe once a week or so for a few hours). When I got covid in Dec 2021, I had no symptoms except my chest again felt a little tight and the breathing issue became more frequent, every day. Mind you its not a major issue, but I am concerned about permanently damaging my lungs. The question I have is, would it be ok to go back to my normal workout routine (Crossfit, i.e. high intensity aerobic workouts) or will I possibly wreck my lungs? How long should i wait?  Anyone else had this issue? The strange thing is my symptoms were SO mild but my chest is still experiencing tightness 1 month later (after my 2nd infection). Welcome any comments from those who may had a similar experience. For background, I am a 29 yr old male, in great health and in excellent physical condition, I work out 5x or more per week at a crossfit gym.

          I contracted COVID two times - October 2020 and in April 2021. Ever since then I’ve been dealing with episodes of hypothermia at unexpected times. My body temperature drops as low as 90° Fahrenheit sometimes and during this time I start to lose consciousness. My body feels lethargic, I have high blood pressure and eventually I start sweating. All this episode takes 10-20 minutes, sometimes even longer. This happens post exertion as well as when I’m resting or taking a nap. Indications of these episodes are sweating, dizziness, body ache, and trepidation. This has affected my lifestyle immensely. I’m only 18 years old. I had these episodes during my final exams as well. I’m also experiencing loss of appetite. Eating heavy or fried foods also cause these episodes. The only thing that helps out is a strong black tea or consuming warm milk or water. We’ve conducted each and very body test possible, been to numerous doctors and no core problem was ruled out. Basic medication to improve immune system and some antibiotics were prescribed each time and none of it improved my situation. I want to know if anybody else has dealt with a situation like this? What remedies helped them? And if there’s any doctor to help me deal with this specific condition?

          I (26F) and my daughter had both tested positive for COVID last month. It has been almost six weeks since I tested positive for COVID. It has been three weeks since my daughter tested positive for COVID. I tested positive for COVID with both a home test and a PCR test before I really noticed symptoms. My daughter tested negative at first, and then positive later. I tested negative on a home test a little over three weeks after I first tested positive. My daughter tested negative on a home test a few days after I tested negative on the home test. We both went to the doctor two days ago, and they tested both of us using a PCR COVID test, and we were negative. They also tested her for a lot of other viruses, and they detected rhinovirus, adenovirus, and human metapneumovirus. We went back yesterday, because my daughter was throwing up. She gets ear infections frequently, so I was worried she had one. They didn't check her ears at the first appointment. They did find that she had an ear infection at the appointment we went to yesterday. They put her on an antibiotic. I am really worried about my child. I am also worried about what I am going through. Even before COVID, I suffered from frequent sinus issues (headaches, pressure, post nasal drip), GERD, pleurisy, muscle and joint pain, etc. I am currently experiencing pain in my legs, fingers, ankles, wrists, arms, and all of my head. I have pressure in my face. I can feel the mucus in my throat. I have a sour taste in my throat. My chest is heavy. It feels like someone has their hand over my mouth and nose. I have pressure and pain in my abdomen and back (I also experienced this before COVID). I am really scared. Do you all think that the tests were accurate?

          I was tested positive December 27th. December 25th &26th, I had symptoms as follows Muscle aches Fever of 101 at its peak Severe sore throat December 27th -29th wet cough and sore throat. I’m unvaccinated and I have serious anxiety issues. I have a sense of doom that’s indescribable. The day I tested positive someone from my high school which was a 42 year old male died from Covid bc he was placed on a ventilator. Now all I can worry about is having the same fate. I literally am wearing a oxygen meter 24/7 watching my levels which are an average of 97. My wet cough concerns me but it has improved. I feel ok today. Weak but moving around. I had a moment of trouble breathing but I emailed a doctor and they Asked my oxygen and it was literally 98-100 at the time of my breathing episode. I contributed it to my anxiety. Tomorrow I will go to urgent care and ask for a catscan but idk if that’s crazy. On top of all of this my girlfriend just recovered from Covid 15 days ago and today she’s feeling sick bc after she quarantined I visited her and I then became sick . Any advice from anyone would be greatly appreciated. My biggest fear is obviously death. Idk if I’m being irrational but Covid is scarier. Being sick is scary.

          Today I’m on Day 6 of Covid and I feel much better but still anxious about all the awful things that could happen to my lungs . Idk if it’s possible for things to turn around now because I have improved n my concern is that things go back to bad because reading online articles say mild symptoms can turn into severe on 5-10 days . My symptoms day 1,2,3,4 were not really mild I’d say . Fever , wet cough and fatigue in bed , groggy and def sick . Day 5 was a huge improvement and now day 6 I’m dry coughing a bit but I’m up n moving around . Started sneezing a bit but I’m still okay . My oxygen is 97-99 and no fever as of this morning .  Being anxious is the worst bc all I can think about it the worst case scenario . I’m a 37 year old male with no bone chronic or underlying conditions . Clearly anxiety n fear . That’s chronic . I’m no doctor but I know I feel much better than the first 4 days but I’m not 100% and that scares me that I’m not out of this thing yet and scared for my lungs  .

          On August 12, 2021 I received my 1st moderna dose. Within a few minutes I had the sensation of pins and needles passing back and forth across my body. At about 15 minutes I was nauseous. By the evening i had diarrhea. The next morning when I woke up my left arm (injection arm) was extremely painful, The pain extended down my arm into my elbow and wrist and my grip strength was diminished.  The pain continued to expand out across my body and into my hips, legs, neck, chest, feet, pretty much every where. My skin buzzed and I had internal tremors. I felt like I was plugged into an electrical outlet. My eyes were inflamed and blurry, my ear were ringing very loudly, I became sun sensitive and it felt like my skin was burning and itchy at the same time. I would sweat very much with very little exertion. My legs were shaky and buckled as I walked. I had extreme pain all over my body with sharp pressure points in several areas including my neck, throat, back/ shoulders, low back, elbows, knees, feet etc. I even had seizures for a few nights. (not grand maul but my body would cramp up and start shaking and shivering uncontrollably). My blood pressure which was borderline high skyrocketed to 198/105 and stayed in the 190's/100's for a few weeks. Anxiety was high, depression setting in, memory and thinking were diminished. Did I mention sharp abdominal pain when pressed? These symptoms progressed for a little over three months and then finally started to subside. As a result of my falling and instability I did get a labral tear in my right hip. Throughout this I have been seen by my general practitioner, rheumatologist orthopedist and yes a psychiatrist for the severe anxiety, depression and cognitive issues. I have had a myriad of blood work completed  for inflammatory markers and autoimmune indicators which all returned normal except as follows; ANA - positiveANCA  ANTIBODIES - positiveATYPICAL P-ANCA TITER - elevated above normal range (1:32 titer  standard less than 1:20 titer)AST - higher than normalChloride - lower than normal So far I get the I don't know, don't worry answer. Maybe you have fibromyalgia. But this is not likely related to the moderna vaccine. You should probably see a cardiologist. Anyone have any thoughts? I hurt all over and everything is tingly, burny and such.

          There is a bit of bad publicity about it in terms of people reporting issues after getting the booster.  But now they are recommending that everyone does and soon with the new variant.  My question is that if one of the things they are reporting is that these new variants are 'outsmarting' our vaccines, is there a point?  Especially if the booster is associated with more adverse events? I have a doctor's appointment this week so will get the 411 for myself but to booster or not to booster. That's the question. Had covid.  Had full dosing of the Pfizer vaccine. I do have a couple of risk factors making me slightly higher risk.

          So, there is some science to support that Covid will peter out.   Viruses, in general, become less virulent over time. Because if they remain deadly, they kill off their hosts and have no place to replicate and spread. Kind of interesting thought.  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095397/  Title of the article:  We shouldn’t worry when a virus mutates during disease outbreaks.  Mutations are an expected part of virology and often, they become less severe as it happens. Would be good news. Seems to be the case for the new covid variant out of South Africa as it is being said to be less severe.  Obviously not getting comfortable or anything, scheduled for my booster next week. But would be great news if this is the case as who doesn't want to see an end of the threat of covid world wide??

I was released with follow up with cardiologist, however exactly on the 2 week of the vaccine I developed some sort of skin rash, started a few red spots on my thigh which went on to be a full blown spots everywhere, thighs lower legs, never seen anything like it, it looks like Petechiae, doesn’t change colour under the glass, I went to the emergency agin they said it’s from shaving after I specifically told the Moron I didn’t  shave. I went to two gp, non knew what it was only that my blood work is good. I called adverse reaction line they said yes it probably is from vaccine. Has anyone had anything like this happen to them? If so how long did it take to go? I have taken antihistamine but nothing is helping it. I really don’t want the second dose since I have had such a hard time with the first. I’m also right now scared of what other side effects the vaccine can bring on, last night I had pin and needles in my hand and forearm , I don’t know if that’s just from my sleeping position.

          Hello I had COVID and pneumonia 3 weeks ago. I tested negative for COVID today and have no symptoms I'm just dealing with the pneumonia now which should be a few more weeks hopefully til I'm 100. Should I get the vaccine now or is it best to wait??

          Hello everyone, I am an illegal immigrant in India (an asylum seeker) and I'm beginning to have some symptoms, but I can't go to the doctor or register to be vaccinated, due to the fear of being deported. So I've just self-quarantined. I'm having some fruits to help my immune system, but my question is, does Azithromycin help? I have absolutely no knowledge of medicine. Is there a chance that taking Azithromycin could only suppress the virus for a while, giving it the chance to evolve and become even more dangerous? I mean delta is already pretty dangerous. I don't know if Azithromycin would only make it worse. I'm sorry if my question is too dumb. And thanks in advance.

          I had Covid-19 in January. I know that those of us who've had it should get the vaccine, but when? The information about when we vaccinate doesn't seem all that clear. Do we still fall into our regular groups? What happens if we still have antibodies? Is it true that if you still have antibodies, the vaccine may interact with them in negative ways?Why do they recommend if you've had covid in the past 2 weeks, that you don't vaccinate? If anyone has some information, or studies, that would be great.

          I realize I am asking a few loaded questions, but what is currently being done to keep pace with COVID mutations?  How can we control such mutations in different areas, such as South America, Europe, and Africa?  I realize that viruses can adapt to different environments, but is there any way to keep such mutations from occurring that are harmful to humans?  Is there any way for the virus to mutate to become harmless?  I would like to pose this question to anyone who can help answer these questions.  Thank you.

          I had a letter today from the NHS here in the UK, an invitation to get vaccinated.In this area they vaccinate with Astrazeneca, in a town 1 hour away they use Pfizer. So many conflicting reports make me anxious and confused, on many NHS pages on social media you get comments directing you to the government site MHRA where a lot of people have listed side effects of the vaccines.Scare stories of blood clots and horrible feelings after taking them including heart problems make it seem risky. People being described as ""sheep"" and downplaying of covid makes it all confusing, especially when there aee some ""medical professionals"" start making claims against covid or the vaccine. I've had the flu before and survived, had the flu jab once and felt horrible for a couple of weeks, achy and headaches and pain in the arm. Had tetanus jabs and for typhoid but didn't react to them. Still anxious to know how I'd react to the covid vaccines. Does the vaccine have bad effects on people with high blood pressure and heart conditions? Those who had angina? I always try to keep myself healthy and go for walk also sometimes cycling.

          This page is updated regularly with data provided by US states, for states that report these statistics.  In what is not likely to be a surprising revelation, most of the severe and deadly infections are occurring in those who are not fully vaccinated. In fact, the vast majority of infections, period, are occurring in the unvaccinated: https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/covid-19-vaccine-breakthrough-cases-data-from-the-states/ I've seen and heard too may people say that it doesn't matter if you get vaccinated or not, because you could still get COVID either way.  Statements like this are known as ""false equivalency,"" made on the bad faith assumption that the two choices have equal merit/outcomes.  While it's true that vaccinated individuals *can* contract COVID and *can* get severe COVID, the level of health and life risk is not even close to equal among the two groups.   I hope the page I shared will be of value to other members here.

She's not vaccinated. There was argument with the hospital as they wouldn't initially do it as she'd be > 10 days but they eventually did it. She's now scheduled and it will be 15 or 16 days since symptoms when getting this. Reading the paperwork on the infusion it says you should be at least 88 lbs and symptoms < 10 days. * Why do they have the 10 day limit? Is it just to ensure consistency of the study, rationing, or is it a legitimate waste or harmful to get it after 10 days. I would think it can help her somewhat.* Is it harmful to get it if under 88 lbs?

Sounds also seem louder than it used to. I was unable to enjoy certain foods due to its extraordinary strong taste compared to before I took the vaccine, but certain foods taste much more delicious than usual.  Is hyper sensitivity a common symptom post vaccination?

I've seen Covid-19 survivors talked about their experiences, which has made me worried even more.  I have two question: What are the chance of me getting infected with the virus? Do you know of any mental support group that could allow me to interact with others, so I'll get less worried.  I have no mental support or friends to share this with right now.  I'm extremely worried of catching Covid-19 or passing it to my family.

          Hello, me and and my sister have got the first dose of Pfizer vaccine yesterday, she suffers from several side effect and lying on the bed all day, in the other hand me doesn’t feel anything and as normal as the normal person can be, my mother has told me that’s mean I have week immune systems and my sister has a strong one. Is that’s right?If someone dosent feel the side effect of the vaccine means she has a week immune system? And if someone suffer from vaccine side effect means she has a strong immune system?

129,Is it correct to say that your unborn child was vaccinated?,https://www.medhelp.org/posts/COVID19/Is-it-correct-to-say-that-your-unborn-child-was-vaccinated/show/3064738,2021-06-06T14:41:58-04:00,jpbadjo,"

          My wife has gotten the Covid 19 vaccination, and during conversation I said that the babies also vaccinated. I was corrected by my friend who said that the baby isn't vaccinated, instead it got its antibodies from intrauterine absorption from the mother. The definition of being vaccinated means obtaining antibodies via a vaccine. My wife got the vaccine, made antibodies, and the antibodies went to the child. It says nothing about being the one getting the shot. So that would literally be the child getting antibodies from the vaccination like the definition says so. I argued that it can be true that the baby got its immunities from the vaccination AND intrauterine absorption as the second is just a process. I have a few questions: Why wouldn't this be the same thing as saying my child vaccinated? They are antibodies obtained via a vaccination, like the definition. The way the covid vaccinations are different right? It trains your DNA to make the antibodies. So wouldn't that also go to the unborn baby through the ambilocal chord since its not like traditional vaccines that use dead or weaker bacteria/viruses? I know its an annoying nit pick, but I want to know.

          I’m a 26 year old male with no pre-existing health conditions other than general anxiety and panic disorder. I take 50 mg of Zoloft daily for that. I recently visited my PCP for some low back pain that I was having that is most likely related to arthritis from an L5-S1 spinal fusion surgery that I had in 2011. My PCP gave me an injection of dexamethasone sodium phosphate to try and help with the inflammation and pain. It seemed to work as the pain has subsided completely, and I only had minor side effects such as body temperature increase and some injection site swelling. Both side effects subsided after about 24 hours. Does this shot make me more susceptible to COVID and other viral/bacterial infections? And if so, for how long?

          My aunty is 65 years old. She has high blood pressure(~140). Her symptoms started with severe headache and body weakness. Next day, Headache was gone but she got fever (~38 degree C) and severe weakness. She started taking Paracetamol and azithromycin. After 4-5 days, she started having cough also. Fever and weakness was as it is. Oxymeter reading is fluctuating between 94-96. She is taking steam inhalation and drinking hot water also along with multivitamins, Zincovit and Vit-C tablets and home remedies like drinking luke warm lemon water or turmeric milk. She is in home isolation but still after 14 days  there is not not much improvement so she went for Covid RT-PCR, CT-Scan and blood test. After 14 days of initial symptoms, her CT-scan score is 5/25, RT-PCT score is 22, CRP protein 2.83 mg/L, platelets 220 thousands/uL, oxymeter Spo2 95-96. She took azithromycin for 10 days now she is taking only paracetamol. But there is not much improvement in SPO2. Fever and weakness is still same. Is there any complications. Is she recovering or not. What medications or precautions should be taken.

          I'm asking a question on behalf of my mother, since she doesn't speak English.She's 52 years old and has had discoid lupus (lupus erythematosus discoides) for 7 years now. Naturally, since it's an autoimmune disease, she's worried about whether she can get vaccinated against COVID19 or not. She had asked one doctor (not an immunologist though) but he hasn't given her a clear answer. She also has not been able to reach an immunologist since it's hard to reach doctors for non-emergencies or non-COVID issues anywhere now. She's currently not taking any treatment for the lupus, as her condition is generally well. The only thing she takes are some antioxidants and amino-acid supplements. So is there any reason to worry about the vaccine for someone with discoid lupus? Thanks in advance.

          Both of the following statements are on the CDC website on pages updated within the past week and a half: 1: COVID-19 Cases are Extremely High. Avoid Events and Gatherings. COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths are extremely high across the United States. To decrease your chance of getting and spreading COVID-19, CDC recommends that you do not gather with people who do not live with you at this time. Attending events and gatherings increases your risk of getting and spreading COVID-19. Stay home to protect yourself and others from COVID-19. (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/holidays.html) 2: Evidence suggests that many K-12 schools that have strictly implemented mitigation strategies have been able to safely open for in-person instruction and remain open. (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/operation-strategy.html) Well which is it? I don't understand why, given certain criteria and and mitigation strategies are satisfied, it is supposed be safe to send my younger child into a public classroom most of the day, every day, yet it is absolutely not safe to see my other child who just left home shortly before the pandemic, even rigorously using all the same mitigation strategies, and with community spread being equal. It just doesn't seem to add up. To better frame my question, first consider my family still at home: Either my wife or I (not both) buys groceries once a week, at the time we believe is the least busy hour of the week. We carefully select and always use PPE based on the best information available. My son is in virtual school, and I work from home, except for rare occasions where it is necessary to go to work to perform my job, and then I follow strict social distancing and all the recommended Covid PPE and safety guidelines. We do get curbside pickup or go through the drive through a couple times a week. Otherwise, we never leave the house except for walks where we will not even be likely to encounter other pedestrians, or for essential doctor visits, or oddball one-off situations, like when we had to have a tire repair. Unfortunately this is against a backdrop of COVID-19 not being taken seriously in the surrounding community, with many acting as though there were no pandemic. Of course our strategies do really minimize encountering such people, but we can't reduce it to zero. Now, I don't have a good feel as to whether we have reduced our risk 70%, 90%, 98%, or even to near zero compared to someone who does not take COVID-19 seriously. Do the experts have a good idea to what the risk would be to people with our lifestyle, or are we still at a point where there is still not enough research or information so that anyone really knows the answer to that question? If there is a good, evidence based estimate on how much the risk is reduced for a family like ours, what would that be? And what is really the risk seeing family members you do not live with, given masks, social distancing, and other guidelines are adhered to? My personal prediction would be that it is less risky than buying groceries, but I would trust evidence that can be defended much more than my gut, and it really bothers me that an organization which is supposed to represent the gold standard for dispensing evidence based guidance makes both of those statements above without offering compelling justification as to why they should both be true.

          Recently it has been published that doctors note that those with gum disease die at a rate of 9 times more when they get covid 19. Interesting and scary.  https://bestlifeonline.com/gum-disease-die-covid-news/  Wonder why? Any thoughts on why this would be?

          I have COVID-19, and all my symptoms have improved except for a daily fever. It's been 14 days since my symptoms first appeared. Do I still have to quarantine? If I do, for how long?

162,Loss of smell and taste?,https://www.medhelp.org/posts/COVID19/Loss-of-smell-and-taste/show/3062743,2021-02-03T14:59:41-05:00,YSI,"

          What controls smell and taste? What causes Covid-19 to make someone lose these senses? I am assuming the lungs or brain in general do not control smell and taste (apart from recognition/identification). So, did those who have this side effect have it because all of their 'pores' on the surface of the tongue and nostrils were clogged with Covid or burned out by Covid? If Covid flew in fast and true beyond the nose and tongue I am guessing it might not cause the smell and taste side effect? Has anyone extensively interviewed (weeding out the psychosomatic suggestibles) Covid patients for specifics about which smells, which tastes, perfume food sweet salty sour fatty alchoholic etc?  Also, would scraping/brushing one's tongue at the time reduce the side effect?

          'IgM levels do wane earlier than IgG' according to the CDC website.  This might explain why my IgM was positive and my IgG was negative-my initial untested illness was almost a year ago.  When they run this antibody test, advertised as a Covid test, does that mean they specifically identified Covid-only antibodies, out of the soup of many other different infections that also might test positive for antibodies? I ask because I did not bother with healthcare at the time of my illness which could have been multiple different viruses besides Covid.  I am really noticing the long-term side effects of my infection from last March. Mental fog-unable to do math calculations I used to be able to do in my sleep lol, and a general fatigue, plus bizarre pounding pulse episodes, which only occur very sporadically without exertion and end quickly, while sitting in my recliner! Also momentary fevers/chills also very sporadically, and rather routine expulsions of green byproduct. I clearly have an ongoing infection of some kind-does Covid leave behind unhealed sores in areas not visible to us?

          My sibling and spouse recently tested positive for IgM and IgG antibodies.  They were minorly ill in November and experienced the classic loss of smell and taste.  They didn't see anyone at the time but when this cheap antibody test was offered 3 months later they were curious.   That made ME curious, lol. I believe I was exposed to Covid on 3/13/2020 (where our state's breakout began.) However... I was also in my sibling's presence face to face in November without masks.  Frankly, I eat and drink so much I am not sure I would notice loss of smell and taste...but I did have the other symptoms of Covid last March, and since.  So my IgM was positive but my IgG was negative. I realize each one could be a false result.  Barring that, what conclusions can I draw from each result?  Is there a test for the age of my antibodies?  Do antibodies have a shelf life after which you might test negative? What other viruses might this test have detected besides Covid? (I did have RSV-B 3 yrs ago.)

          https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.26514 excerpt from above article:  [Listerine Antiseptic is an alcohol‐based eucalyptol, menthol, methyl salicylate, and thymol formulation that historically has claimed numerous antimicrobial properties. It currently lists only a claim to kill germs that cause bad breath. Our tests show that it is highly effective at inactivating HCoV in solution (Table 3). Even at the lowest contact time of 30 s it inactivated greater than 99.99% of HCoV. Interestingly, other related products (Listerine Ultra, Equate Antiseptic, and CVS Antiseptic Mouth Wash), while showing substantial reductions, were not as efficient as Listerine Antiseptic (Table 3). These three products were unable to show a reduction of greater than 99.99% with 30‐s contact time. Equate required 2‐min contact time to show a greater 99.99% reduction.] I believe quite often medical research is the end result of general public questions, experiences, pressure, etc.  I would like to believe the medical sciences lead the pack, but have often seen otherwise. Example: the esteemed professional who said on national TV in the early days that we the public should not wear masks.  It is unwise to censor valuable public comment. We should merely be asked to disclaim any personal scientific certification. I am not certified (nor certifiable lol.)  I have strong common sense beliefs that airborn viruses take root primarily in the nasal passages first, and will then travel to your throat mouth lungs etc.  I believe in the efficacy of wiping your nostrils out after public exposure during viral outbreak seasons with tissues dabbed with regular Listerine.  I have been doing this during flu season for many years and have not had influenza for a decade.  I found a study (above.) The study has limitations. That study needs to be expanded to real research on covid-infected people. Have they done so yet?

          Hi all. This is just a general question. I keep seeing that there have been studies that people with Type O blood, may be protected against COVID, or have a lesser chance of contracting it. And if they do get it, it may be a less severe case. I also saw that RH negative blood, especially O negative, is showing potentially even more protection against COVID. Does anyone else know anything about this? Or have an opinion? I have O positive blood, and it just peaked my interest.

          Hi everyone. I am on day 6 post exposure. My exposure was that I had my mom in the passenger seat of my car while I was driving for about an hour and a half on Sunday, the next day she began with symptoms, and Tuesday morning tested positive (her and my father) on a rapid test. My husband is an RN that is able to bring home rapid tests if and when needed.I haven't had symptoms. Today I feel a little achy  but that could just be my kids tiring me out! I tested on Wednesday, day 3...rapid test negative. Then again this morning...rapid test...day 6..negative. I know it can be up to 2 weeks, but generally most people would show positive by now, right? Also, is riding in the car with an infected person the day before they had symptoms a big risk? With me driving and her in the passenger seat? Windows were up, due to it being winter.

I decided to get tested because since Christmas eve i I've had a slight fever, a flu,a slight sore throat and apparently i can't smell anything up to this day, and my eyes kind of hurt(?) I don't really know how to explain this one. So to anticipate the result of the test being reactive, what should i do then? I didn't had any other symptoms other than this. Thank you guys

          The tech isn't there yet, but some companies are hoping by year end to be able to create 5 minute tests that are highly accurate. If successful, applications include things like a stadium or workplace employer being able to do 3,000 tests per hour with the results available within 5 minutes on the person's phone. I read about one city in NA today where only 1/3 of people called by the contact tracers of a health authority because of a potential exposure even bothered to answer the message they received.

Finally after testing every week (was symptom free after day 3) received a negative pcr test 4 weeks from initial positive. Was symptom free and no issues at all. In August for a routine check up my primary tested me for antibodies which I had (expected).  Fast forward to a week ago a co worker tested positive and exposed me to covid. Exactly 6 months later. No issues went to the primary and again tested for antibodies and again positive for them. 2 days ago experienced headache and elevated temp (99.5) got tested. Positive on the antigen rapid test BUT negative on the PCR test. Again this is 5 days after exposure. Clinic says it was a false positive on the antigen test.  Still have headache and fever similar to the original symptoms I had.  Covid again or not ? I will test again with PCR

Isn’t the virus kind of everywhere in the liquids of your respiratory system? b) why is the nasal swab for coronavirus so deep? We’re supposed to keep the social distance of 1,5 m, which means that it should actually be more than enough to analyse a spit, a snot or just a swab from your tongue or from the beginning of your nostrils or at least just not that deep. Thanks

We  both live together, and we've been sleeping in the same bed, share food, kiss, intimacy, yet my results came back negative. Going back couple weeks (nov 3rd thru the 5th), I think i caught the cold from my gf. She started having runny nose and coughs. I caught the cold from her around the 4th i think, started getting coughs, runny nose and mild sore throat. It hit the hardest for me on the 5th. Had terrible cough (phlegm), bad headache, but next day it was better, and on Sunday i fully recovered. My gf had gone to a state where there was many known covid cases. She went from 6th, came back on  9th. Then started feeling COVID symptoms on the 11th. She had fatigue, loss and taste and smell, and mild coughs. She tested postive for COVID on Nov 18th. Nov 19th is when i started feeling something, mild body aches, then the 21th, i had sore throat, and a headache - That same day, i went to get tested with my gf testing again, but I came back NEGATIVE, while she retained her POSITIVE. Today, I seem fine, my sore throat is still there, but i can feel it getting better. But im curious as to why I got a negative? Do i have low viral load? I take multivitamins, which includes D and i also take Zinc 50mg daily. My gf is better now, she has a senses back completely as of today. We are going to get tested again tomorrow. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Then nausea and vomiting.5. diarrhea is next.  (different from Sars which usually sees diarrhea before nausea).  ""This order is especially important to know when we have overlapping cycles of illnesses like the flu that coincide with infections of COVID-19,"" said scientist Peter Kuhn, who worked alongside scientist James Hicks and doctoral candidate Joseph Larsen.

I have no motivation to do things I normally would enjoy, I just play video games all day. Since Covid hit, my depression has only gotten worse. I am isolated in my home, alone, as I have a compromised immune system with diabetes, asthma and high blood pressure. When I do go out to get groceries I am hyperaware of everyone around me. Are they wearing a mask, are they wearing it properly, are they using their sleeve to cough into even though they are wearing a mask?  My anxiety is very high when I need to go out and I'm a nervous wreck by the time I get home. I just don't know how to dig myself out of this and it is getting worse as positive Covid numbers are rising every day, even more now than when it started.

          We know that health institutions worldwide have urged people to avoid mass gatherings, or really, gathering at all, during the current and upcoming holiday season.   I am hopeful that no one here is planning to ignore the warnings, but is anyone getting pressure to do so? I host Thanksgiving dinner every year, and invite all family and friends to join in.  This year, we're only having my parents over (they have been isolated, and so have we) for a few hours.  I feel a bit bad, because this means that some of my friends will spend Thanksgiving alone, or alone as a couple, but I've been extremely honest about our reasons: ""We would love to have you  join us, but we're playing it safe, and helping stop the spread.  Hopefully, we can celebrate together next year.""  I still feel somewhat guilty. What's everyone else doing, and if you're isolating, how do you turn down suggestions to gather?

I have touched the door knobs of the store ... there was no one else in the store at that time ... Question - do you have to touch virus on surface and directly touch your mouth , nose or ears .. if you touched other surfaces like my car steering ..etc .. does the viral load get reduced .. assuming there is virus in the first place .. Apart from that I have not done any other risky behavior ... am I just overthinking and being paranoid ?

          A warning from the CDC states that being overweight will increase odds of having a poor outcome if you contract corona.  Having 'extra pounds' puts you at risk.  Uh Oh.  I'm in some trouble there.  And I'm in good company as three quarters of the US may be at greater risk because of this.  BMI is one of the measures. AND you are overweight with a BMI of 25 to 19 and obese with a BMI of 30 or more.  I might be like one slice of pie away, I'm afraid.  Obese people are twice as likely to be hospitalized with covid.  We've known the issue with obesity but the overweight, extra pounds threw me off a bit.  That's a lot of people.  SO, are you on a covid diet?  Are you trying to get thinner to help all of your health issues but also to keep strong and safe if you happy to contract covid?  I'm NOT gonna lie. It's another motivating factor to lose some poundage for this cheesecake lover.

          Recently I stayed at a hotel for work purposes. The cleanliness was okay as far as I could tell but reviews are mixed on typical review sites, some stating clean, others not. I had no cleaning products so I used hand sanitizer with my own clean cloth to clean the only table which I placed my laptop/phone and keys on to do do some work. Even after I used the faucet handles, I sanitized my hands. I cannot recall touching my face, mouth or nose. COVID19 is relatively low in my area of the country (NJ/PA) and my anxiety got the better of me that I actually left after 2-3 hours of my stay and drove home. Normal check in time is 4PM and checkout time is 11AM. So quite a bit of time even if the last person had left any respiratory droplets on said table. The room was also rather hot when I entered. I'm probably reaching but do I have much to be concerned about? I always wear my mask in public and keep 6ft distance whenever I'm around anybody not wearing a mask.

          Sorry -- this may sound like paranoia. I live in an apartment building and as I was turning a corner inside the building, someone coming from the opposite side of the corner I was turning literally bumped into me for a second. He had no mask on, while I had a mask and glasses on. This was literally a 1-2 second ""interaction"" as we essentially bumped into each other, but kept moving. I assume this is very low risk, but just seeing what anyone else may think. The area where I am at now was the epicenter of the pandemic when it began, but of course is doing much, much better now. Just concerns me this guy had no mask on (I think he said ""sorry"" as we walked past each other), and by bumping into me, we clearly weren't 6 feet apart (and this was inside the building). But this was as brief of an exposure as you can get and I did have a mask on, although he did not. Thoughts?

I read that it can survive in the air for 3 hours, but in that experiment, i believe they were using fans to blow it and keep it in the air, but im not sure. Meanwhile other sources i read told me it only stays airborne for 14 minutes. Say for example, a girl named Marsha has coronavirus and her roommate, Jan, stays in her own bedroom. Marsha walks through the hallway and breaths in the hallway right outside of Jan's bedroom, then Marsha leaves and goes somewhere else. 2 hours later, Jan walks out of her bedroom and breaths the same air and walks though it, can Jan get coronavirus? Is something like that actually possible?

          Hello,I have a question for medical professionals. My wife and I need marriage counseling. It will probably be more effective face to face. We have a three year old and a six year old. If we’re going to leave the house, we need a babysitter.  I am a middle school choir teacher and start teaching in person 4 days a week very soon. Even though I will be wearing a mask and my students will, I feel like this means my family poses a higher risk of infection to anyone we ask for help. Since we are most likely to have an evening appointment, that means the girls will need to be fed or put to bed. Social distancing is unlikely.  I need to know that if a friend or family member is helping us out, we are not putting them at risk of infection, especially if the people who help are my 68 year old parents.  Does anyone have advice on PPE and strategies we can use to keep our babysitters safe? Also, please list your credentials when answering my questions and thank you for your help.

          I'm pretty nervous about coronavirus COVID-19. Every time you turn on the TV or get on the internet, there's some new information about the virus, or how far it's spread. I'm trying to prepare as best I can, like making sure I use hand sanitizer and having plenty stocked up.  I'm not sure if I'm at risk or not, since I'm young and relatively healthy, and I don't even know if anything I'm doing will help me from getting sick.  How do you wade through ALL of this information and know what to do to prevent getting it, and what to do if there's an outbreak near you?

          I may have been exposed to Covid on March 13. (Tour bus to and from a casino near a community with an outbreak related to travelers returning home from an Egyptian cruise. I left home at 9am back home by 7pm.)  That night, I experienced a sudden dry barking chain of 6 coughs in about 1 minute (it felt like a flea had bit the back of my throat, just beyond the uvula) which was immediately followed by sudden onset flood of fluid from my sinuses down the back of my throat which was immediately followed by a separate flood of saliva into my mouth which triggered an overwhelming desire to throw up. I was retching and spitting but staved off throwing up. (zinc lozenge and mouthwash to trick the urge.) I then cycled between chills and feverish for 3 days. After 3 days I was fine... but I did experience a few days of skyrocketed blood pressure weeks later with tight pulsating base of neck and sharp stabs of pain under left lower rib cage. Today I feel great. Feverish was 98.2 and MY normals run mid 96 to mid 97. (Couple yrs ago recovering from RSV I bottomed out in the mid 95's.)  My average body temp is always below what guidelines declare is normal. If I am feverish but below temp guidelines am I contagious to anyone whose body temp is higher than mine?

          For the past three weeks my partner and I have been showing very similar symptoms including full-body aches, nausea, and chills. However, these symptoms tend to flare up for both us on the same days and - in one case - down to almost the same time.  Day 1: Three weeks ago my partner (who I live with) woke up with chills, full-body aching, and was having a hard time breathing - the latter of which lasted about 3 hours before improving. Concerned this was COVID and since she has a slightly compromised immune system, we went to the ER. She was ultimately cleared to go home and her tests came back negative. That same morning, I also woke up feeling terrible. I had full body aches and chills, as well as nausea, but had no breathing issues. Assuming it was something I ate and just coincidental timing with my partner's symptoms, I did not get tested for COVID. My partner had been showing some lighter symptoms w/out breathing issues a few days prior. I had shown no prior symptoms. Both my partner and I felt ill from around 6am until 2/3pm. The transition from feeling ill to feeling better was really quick. My partner went back to just mild symptoms and I was nearly 100% better. (We quarantined for 14 days out of an abundance of caution.) Day 2: Six days after day 1, we woke up with the exact same symptoms we had individually experienced on day 1: partner had trouble breathing, I had nausea, and we both had full body aches and chills. These symptoms lasted maybe 5-6 hours this time. Again, once they were over, they were over. We were back to feeling normal by that evening. Day 3: Just yesterday (just over 3 weeks since day 1 and about 2.5 weeks since day 2) we both started feeling ill again after a couple weeks of feeling fine. This time, our symptoms started at around 6:30pm and they lasted about 3 hours. The freaky part was that our symptoms flared up almost down to the minute and came on like a light switch. Within 20 minutes or so we both went from feeling fine to feeling chills, aches, nausea, and partner had tightness of chest again. We are both mid-twenties, generally healthy, get consistent exercise, etc. Outside of partner's immune system (IgA deficiency) we have no other underlying conditions. Between our symptom flare ups, we have felt generally well. Is this COVID and the test just came back false negative, or something else? And why we are experiencing symptoms at nearly the same times?

And I talk all the precautions. I can't breastfeed him as I'm not producing milk and my nipples are cracked. I heard breastmilk is really neat for the child. And this virus is making me go nuts and making me think beyond. I am losing my mind so I was wondering do babies have high chance of getting the virus if they are not breastfed.I know u sound dumb but coronavirus is giving me some weird thoughts

My wife looks at me with this horrified look on her face, I think she's being silly, but she mentions that's how this can spread. Now, I try to be the level headed one and mention that 1 the virus would have been washed away by now and 2 it doesn't travel/survive on food (from what I've read). However, as time passes, I find my mind spiraling out of control about the possibility that it could be true. Is it possible that she may be right?

          Would hyperbarics chambers oxygenize in a different way than ventilators, or is it the same thing? I declined admission 2yrs back when I had RSV (b) even though I felt a bit desperate for oxygen (and really sucked it down in the ER.) I was at 85% and left at 95%. I was surprised they don't send you home with prescribed oxygen. (Been wondering about those little canisters of oxygen they sell in catalogs, and those oxygen bars lol.) At the time, as my lungs filled, I kept fantasizing about the dental hygienist's suction tool!

          Copper kills bacteria and viruses in minutes and even Coronavirus cannot survive for long. "" The process involves the release of copper ions (electrically charged particles) when microbes, transferred by touching, sneezing or vomiting, land on the copper surface. The ions prevent cell respiration, punch holes in the bacterial cell membrane or disrupt the viral coat, and destroy the DNA and RNA inside."" 1. Why is Copper not used more in hospitals on door handles, toilet facilities etc? Ultra violet light at certain frequencies kills viruses. They do use it in some hospitals to steralise rooms and equipment but it is hazardous for humans. However there is now a new frequency identified that is not harmful. "" far-UVC light (207-222 nm) efficiently inactivates bacteria without harm to exposed mammalian skin. This is because, due to its strong absorbance in biological materials, far-UVC light cannot penetrate even the outer (non living) layers of human skin or eye; however, because bacteria and viruses are of micrometer or smaller dimensions, far-UVC can penetrate and inactivate them. "" 2. Why are hospitals not using this virus killing light in ICU setting and what about this new safe form of UV light? (Could be used on school equipment too)

          I live in a 55+ condo community. We had our association meeting last night. Ages 63-95. 5 people at  table 1, not distanced, 1 with mask, 2 w/masks in hand, 2 without masks. 3 people at table 2, 1 distanced but no mask, 2 not distanced (married) but w/masks. I then sat at table 3, distanced, with mask. The first thing is that the two speakers (board members) at table 1 waved the masks in their hands (one of them has high volume public contact daily) and said they were not going to wear them unless anyone objected.  Another board member with mask then removed her mask in generational conformity, leaving 5 without mask and not distanced at table 1. The woman without mask at table 2 has a hearing disability and then walked over to table 1 and spoke to two of the ladies ~6inches face to face to repeat loudly (droplets...) what was under discussion.  I have been wearing masks when flu season starts, for many years. I will never forget Dr Fauci standing in front of America and saying ""Don't wear a mask.""  (I understand what he was trying to say don't wear MEDICAL-GRADE masks because healthcare providers need them. They need to read from proof-read scripts only, imo.)  So the local farm supply store is selling pkgs of 5 K N95 masks for ~$20 and there were a hundred packages, 2 companies, made in China. Nice masks. Mom and I bought a package to share and the spares will come in handy this coming flu season.  So is K N95 the same as N95??

          As everyone probably knows, they've been testing Remdesivir, developed originally to fight ebola. Today Dr. Fauci announced that they were going to stop testing with a placebo group vs. a group that gets the drug, because it was clear the drug helps. He said that the median recovery time for patients taking the drug was 11 days, compared with 15 days in the placebo group. There was a mortality rate of 8% for the group receiving Remdesivir versus 11.6% for the placebo group Gilead, the lab that developed Remdesivir, simply announced that in their own testing, 50% of people getting a five-day dose of Remdesivir saw improvement.  Dr. Fauci compared this to when the first drugs were found to be helpful in the fight against AIDS. No one drug immediately solved the problem, but the first one that helped was encouraging. Who was really encouraged was the stock market! (And me, who had been thinking getting Covid-19 would doom me to having a stroke or heart damage or just be an automatic death sentence.) Anyway, the market bounded upward at the news, though Gilead's stock, while it did go up, didn't go as crazy as one might expect. (Maybe the analysts read the news as ""only"" 50% of people improved). But the market on the whole clearly thought the glass was half full, not half empty. lol

          I'm not generally an anxious person, and haven't felt nervous really about covid19 thus far. It's exacerbated my depression some, but I haven't been afraid.  Now I am, though, with all this talk about opening the country. Is anyone else? I'm in a fairly hot hot-spot. We haven't even hit our peak yet, according to experts, but we may be at least partially open before the peak, which I don't understand.  I don't want to be political.

          His theory is not in the mainstream media that I follow and is based solely on his statistical inference from other countries, so it's all analysis of a novel disease in a few countries.

          I understand that there are 2 line of though on febrile response. 1. fever is part of the disease and should  be suppressed at al costs to make the person feel better, 2. fever is the immune systems response to a viral, bacterial or parasitical infection.  f course that is oversimplifying the mechanics of it all. Personally I have found that my family, ( kids of 9 and 10 and wife aged 47) have always recovered quick from viral infections if we let the fever run it's course without intervention. Recently we have all recovered from Covid, with myself still dealing with the lack of smell and taste . . My kids have had temperatures of upto 41 when they had chicken pox and cognitively they have no issues. So why if Covid virus replication slows down at over 38 degrees does the standard advice include anti pyretics.I mean surely that would lead to a worse outcome

          Dear Community.  I know it's prob. a slightly controversial question, but I'm not asking it because of that.  It's just as this comes from bats, surely the reason bats don't die from it is because they never social-distanced(!) just kept right on mixing and all those that survived became immune.  As we've BEEN social distancing, and say we're going BACK to social distancing should cases increase, wouldn't that make herd immunity take a LOT longer to build up? Shouldn't we just bite the bullet, remember how small a percentage actually die from the disease (the reason the UK Govt. DOWNGRADED it on March 20th - they don't tell you that in the news!) and let the cases spread a bit to build up immunity? Yours puzzledly Chris.

          What does the future hold? Mutations are a natural part of the virus life cycle, this virus is also going to mutate. If and when the vaccine is out, maybe the virus could adapt to it and develop resistance. E.g. Researchers in Brazil traced the virus, they isolated SARS-CoV-2 from two patients confirmed to have COVID-19. They sequenced the complete genomes of both samples of the virus, not only did they find that genomes differ from each other but also they were totally different from the genomes of the virus samples sequenced in Wuhan, China. Based on a recent chinese research, Coronavirus has already mutated into two strains the ""S"" type and the ""L"" type, the former one being the aggressive type that was found responsible for 70% of the total infection.  There are greater minds at work to find a vaccine to this virus. However, any such treats and advancements can be discussed here on this thread.

          I apologize for what might be a ridiculous question, but here goes: We received a grocery delivery today. The shopper was not wearing a mask but was wearing gloves. He left the groceries on the front porch and I retrieved them. After unpacking everything and washing up; maybe about an hour or so after, we were fitting all the grocery packaging and grocery bags into one big trash bag to be disregarded and put out of sight. As I was stuffing the last small bag (containing other items) into the larger one, the lack of room and my attempting to stuff everything to create room resulted in a plume of air pushing out from the garbage directly onto my face (was not wearing a mask at this point).  I'm now wondering whether if there was contamination on the items that were in the bag, if the forcing of air out of the bag could in a sense pull the virus off the surface of the items and in into the escaping air, hypothetically resulting in an aerosolized issue for my face. It wasn't like I was breathed on from another person, but could it be possible that, hypothetically, the virus could have been released from the surfaces of the thrown away packaging by way of the air plume? I know there are a lot of unknowns right now and I had read about aerosol issues, so hoping this realistically wouldn't be one as I am definitely in a hot spot now. Thanks.

In the past week after eating out it’s become unbearable nothing like the mild ones I experienced before  where I went to the my primary care immediately but my chest X-ray was negative for anything as well as EKG. I also just went to the ER and received  a breathing treatment which helped but didn’t completely solve my problem. I don’t have a fever, rarely cough, and haven’t been out of the country. The chest tightness/pain has been my only symptoms. I do have some intestinal discomfort but I attribute that to an earlier condition from last October. I am at high risk for infections due to asthma as a child and bronchitis as a teenager.

          generally l wouldnt associate the two but vague references to red eyes and the fact my mother has COPD and works in a care home makes me wonder if she should call the relevant professionals.. at the moment because there isnt pain or soreness she plans to ignore it.. but lm worried it could be something more serious.

          Doctors in Iran, Britain, Italy and China reported that many patients without respiratory symptoms lost their sense of smell then taste. Cooks with Covid can't identify the foods in their dishes or taste them and a mother couldn't smell her baby's diaper mess. Article also mentions this note about ENT doctors .............who advised against performing nonessential sinus endoscopy procedures on anyone, because the virus replicates in the nose and the throat and an exam can prompt coughs or sneezes that expose the doctor to a high level of virus. Two ear, nose and throat specialists in Britain who have been infected with the coronavirus are in critical condition, Dr. Hopkins said. Earlier reports from Wuhan, China, where the coronavirus first emerged, had warned that ear, nose and throat specialists as well as eye doctors were infected and dying in large numbers, Dr. Hopkins said.https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html

          Hello,I have mild-moderate mitral regurgitation (see enclosed description). I am 53yo, the situation is non-rheumatic, stable (due to a slender valve shape), my situation is stable I am otherwise healthy and fit. I read online that ""Patients who have heart valve abnormalities that are well compensated and well-tolerated at baseline, are more susceptible to heart failure if they were to become infected with coronavirus. Because of the underlying heart valve issues, if damage to the pumping chamber of the heart were to occur, patients would be less able to tolerate that."" Am I at greater risk of developing severe illness should I be infected? (Should I take greater than usual precautions so as not to get infected?) I would really appreciate any answer you could provide. Thank you!

          So in layman's terms, who is high risk? Are people of a certain age automatically high risk, even if we're healthy? My kids are all over me to stay inside because I'm in my 70s, but I'm healthy.  If I don't have diabetes, heart disease or lung issues, do I have to stay inside? Can't I go to dinner at my friends' houses?

          I've been under the impression that coughing spreads the virus to others through breathing it in. Lately I've been confused by certain health authorities statements since they conflict with that idea. Today I read this statement from the head of a Health Authority governing 930,000 people in North America. ""Carr reiterated that the good news about COVID-19 is that it's not airborne and is transmitted by personal contact. But that's why he said being strict about social distancing and self-isolation is so important."" I presume what he means is if someone coughs the droplets can only infect a surface that is 6 feet away (including your face and air passageway) that you might touch later and end up infected. So inhaling them within 6 feet of the cougher can infect you, otherwise you are safe if farther away. Or does someone else know the answer? If so a direct quote and a link would be appreciated.

          Anyone who reads a lot of articles about Covid quickly discovers that age 60 is the average age people have got it, and that underlying conditions and age are the primary reasons people die. The average fatality rate is 80.However this article about Iran claims ""Zali also acknowledged ""many"" of those who have died from COVID-19 were otherwise healthy, a rare admission by local authorities that the virus does not only prey on the sick and elderly."" https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/iran-reports-113-virus-deaths-containment-concerns-mount-200315180552632.htmlIran's government has not been trustworthy and there isn't any external review of their claims, fwiw. 7 different studies a week ago estimated an average of 2M infected Iranians, but the government spokespeople numbers are much lower.

          I had a septic blood disease 5 years ago which caused spots on my lung and my brain. I was hospitalized for 32 days over the course of three months. Typically IV antibiotics would cure this within six weeks but it took 24 weeks of hardcore IV antibiotics through a PICC line. Does this make my immune system more susceptible to catching the coronavirus at this time? I am a diabetic and it is completely under control now but since I was on such high steroids throughout my infection my retinas were completely destroyed and I am legally blind now. I don't leave the house very often.

          The title of this week old article from healthing.ca is ""'We don't have to worry about our kids dying': Immunologist"".  As the world watches COVID-19 take hold in our communities, there’s one trend that has caught the curiosity of researchers: why are kids not responding the same way to the virus as adults?While it was originally believed that children were immune to the virus, there are now cases involving children — at least one in Alberta, and 17 in Ontario, including one involving a baby boy.Dawn Bowdish, the Canada Research Chair in Aging and Immunity, says that we now know children are infected at the same rate as adults, but that they don’t necessarily show the symptoms.“When they do show the symptoms, they’re very mild compared to adult symptoms,” she says. “This shows us that the virus can get into kids’ bodies, they just don’t get very sick.”Older adults and those with pre-existing health conditions seem to be the most at risk compared to children.One study in JAMA found that reported cases in children were ‘rare’ as the average age for coronavirus patients was between 49 to 56 years old. Another study from the New England Journal of Medicine examined 425 patients, finding that no one under the age of 15 had the virus. The WHO has reported that 2.4 per cent of cases were children under the age of 18, while only 0.2 per cent of cases were cases where children were seriously ill.“We don’t have to worry about our children dying,” says Bowdish. However, she acknowledges that the virus’ death rates vary from country to country, and vulnerable populations are the most at risk everywhere, including in Canada.“Right now, children aren’t going to be the ones filling up our emergency rooms, it’s going to be older adults.” she says.Of course, if you suspect your child is sick, it’s a good idea to get them tested just in case.Currently, health experts don’t understand whether children can transmit the virus in the same way that they can transmit influenza in a community outbreak — meaning spreading it to parents, grandparents, classmates, etc. In influenza outbreaks, taking measures such as shutting down schools or vaccinating against the illness can break the transmission of the virus, benefitting the whole community. In the case of COVID-19, we just don’t know the role that kids play in its spread.    Health experts don’t understand whether children can transmit the virus the same way they can transmit influenzaWith March Break approaching Bowdish says it could cause the infection to spread, as many families head out on vacation to the U.S. and international destinations. The Ontario government recently announced the closure of all publicly funded schools in Ontario for two weeks following March break, in response to the growing number of cases of COVID-19. It’s a move that she says is “excellent.”“Families [who may get infected] will come back from their March Break holiday and have two weeks before the kids end up back at school. Hopefully, that will be sufficient to slow down transmission,” she says. Bowdish adds that the earlier we take these measures to reduce the spread of infection before the health care system is overburdened, the better chance it has to help.While closing the schools will definitely help to prevention infection, Bowdish says there is another way — one that is harder than the other. Staying away from grandparents.“Grandparents are everyone’s defacto babysitter,” she says. “This is problematic because this virus infects older adults and causes them to become severely ill.” She suggests that parents find alternative childcare if they can.Another prevention strategy is teaching children how to properly wash their hands. Not only does educating kids on how they can protect themselves empower them and make them feel like they have a little bit of control in such an uncertain time, it also teaches them that they also have a role to play in keeping other people safe.    Families [who may get infected] will come back from their March Break holiday and have two weeks before the kids end up back at school. Hopefully, that will slow down transmissionBowdish says these measures are important, as they help adults and children take care of themselves. While the virus may seem like a regular flu, it’s important for parents, and children to step up and take precautions whenever they can.“Anytime we have a bad flu year or an epidemic, [these] cause mortality and our hospitals become strained,” she says. “That’s one of the consequences we’re going to see here. We need to break the transmission of the virus.”
