I got COVID in January and a few weeks after i got rid of the virus I started getting muscle twitches all over my body (fasciculations). I've also noticed a rippling effect in my muscle fibres during contraction.

I was wondering if anyone has also experienced similar symptoms after beating the virus?"

                            ",I just want to share my experience with COVID rebound (and just for reference I'm a 64 yr old male in otherwise good health) .  After my initial positive covid home test I contacted my dr and was prescribed paxlovid all was well at first and I started getting better within a couple of days and tested negative about the third day of taking it. I continued to feel better until a few days after finishing the 5th day of paxlovid. Then I started feeling ill again with even worse symptoms including a mild fever  for several days and sinus infection symptoms. I am right now at almost 3 weeks from my first onset of COVID and close to one week into the rebound and still COVID positive.  So if I were to do it over I would probably NOT take paxlovid and maybe my immune system would have killed it the first time and I may not have had to go through it again. So just wondering if anyone else has gone through this and how long did it take to fully recover ?

I feel perfectly fine other than some sinus congestion and sinus drainage. I'm scared to go to the er cause my father passed away in February from it. I think it could be triggering me.

My sense of taste was not affected. After a few weeks it started to come back and all seemed fine. Then a couple of weeks ago just after the new year when eating a mint I noticed a very odd chemical taste. Everything else tasted fine. Then a little over a week ago I opened up a peanut butter jar and it smelled horrible. Smelled just like that chemical taste of the mint but 100x worse. Now last week many things have a faint chemical smell. I thought it might be a new detergent or something but my wife swears nothing has changed. It is faint and if I did not suffer from GAD then I probably wouldn't notice it.

The best I have been able to figure out is in very late December I was using some paint stripper, which seems to be very close to the chemical smell, and that somehow my nose wires got crossed. I was in a pretty well ventilated area. When I am outside I do not smell this at all. When I come back in I swear I can smell chemicals but NO ONE else in the house can smell anything.

I do not believe this to be a neurological issue as in late October I had an MRI for other reasons and nothing was discovered. 

Have any other people post COVID had issues smelling and tasting chemicals or other odd tastes/smells? If so what did you do to help the issue?

Thanks!"

                            ","Like many others, I have had Covid three times now. The first time was in Jan 2021 and it lasted a month. I lost the sense of smell and taste for almost a month, couldn't breathe through my nose for over a week and stayed moderately congested for 2 additional weeks, had consistent fevers, chills, headaches and coughing for six days straight, couldn't eat for a week (my stomach hurt so badly, but I couldn't keep anything down and was too nauseous to try to eat), had a persistent sore throat for a week, and was dehydrated. However, the worst symptom was severe shoulder pain. I mean intense, felt like I was on fire, shoulder pain in both shoulders. My partner attempted to massage them for me once, but the slightest touch put me in tears. They burned so badly! The intensity lasted about 4 days, and slowly departed over the course of 2 weeks. I did go to the ER in the beginning (around day 2) because I couldnt breathe well and the shoulder pain was intense, but they said my O2 levels were good, my lungs were clear, and to go home and get rest. They prescribed Tessalon Pearls and Amoxicillin, and said to take OTC pain relievers for the shoulder pain.  

Thereafter, I received 2 Moderna vaccinations, wore masks every day, used sanitizer and washed my hands regularly, and didn't go in public other than to pick up my grocery orders to avoid going in public places- it was work and home. Despite those efforts, in Dec 2021, I got Covid again. That time around it was more like the flu. I did experience body aches that time, but it was mild and not general to one location. I did not get the boosters because I developed myocarditis after the 2 Moderna vaccinations and it was recommended by my doctor to wait until more findings come out to avoid more stress on my heart in case I developed the condition again with the boosters. After a week of Covid #2, I was fine. 

Despite the regulations lifting thereafter, I maintained wearing the masks daily, limited my outings to parks, trails, and remote locations with my kids despite my family and friends unwavering pleas to go out (they think Im paranoid), still picked up grocery orders, continued to wash my hands and use sanitizer regularly, etc., and as of this Friday, I have developed Covid again. I have a constant sore throat, persistent fevers/chills/headaches, nausea/vomiting/diarrhea (sorry), difficulty sleeping, severe fatigue (but cant sleep!!!), and body aches. The shoulder pain is back and I am on day 3 as I type this. It is not as intense as the first time, but it is moderate, and the doctor I saw couldnt explain it or diagnose the issue. They offered pain meds, but I wont take them. I want to treat the cause, not the symptom. I cant find much online about it and the closest thing I can find is related to shoulder neuropathy (Im not even sure if that is the correct terminology). I am wondering if anyone else has experienced this, and if so, what are your doctors saying about the condition? My only medical condition prior to any of this is hypothyroidism which runs in my family, and yes, unfortunately, I am a smoker.

Does anyone have any information on this symptom? Is it common? Will it go away? Are there studies that it could be longer lasting or damaging in the long run? I can't find too much on it and I know studies are still ongoing as Covid is new for us all, but the shoulder pain at times is intense. It truly feels like they are on fire- a burning sensation from the inside out. Hot to the touch, can't touch the shoulders at times as the pain gets intense, and Aleve, Tylenol, and ice/hot packs are ineffective. Im just drained and afraid of what is to come as reports coming out are now stating increased risks to health each time we get the virus, and it seems no matter the precautions taken, reinfection is inevitable- at least for me.  Any information anyone can share or provide would be greatly appreciated! The doctors here wont run tests on it, and while this bout is not as bad as the first time, the pain at times is unbearable. Thank you in advance!"

                            ","Hi,

I've had Covid19  for 4 weeks and if I had the energy I'd be tearing my hair out.
I've had 2 sets of prohylactic antibiotics to safeguard against bacterial infections, my temperature has been up and down but never higher than 38 the entire illness.
I've had severe neuropathy during the illness and some kind of night seizures accompanying the other more well publicised symptoms that mean my sleep is terrible also.

I went to hospital Day 14  after a week of seriously thinking I'm on death's door and my blood oxygen was good enough to be sent home for follow up at the Covid Hubs where they basically just take temperature, pulse and oxygen levels.
I was prescribed a 2nd course of antibiotics there as my temperature was still up and they are checking in on me every few days.

Meanwhile I am having one better day, then another terrible day, then a better day then a worse day..But 'better' is still bed ridden, just means I can breath well enough and not too dizzy to make myself my own cup of tea, have a shower and engage in some small talk with my family. 
Everytime I have a good few hours I think, that must be me getting well now, but no, 4 weeks later and the last 24 hrs my breathlessness has been worse than it was for the previous 5 days..Am about ready to shoot myself.
Is there anyone else that's experienced being so ill with this virus outside of an ICU setting where it's carried on this long?
Even ICU patients are recovering in 3-6weeks .
Cannot understand why I'm not getting well yet.
I have no underlying health issues and I'm in my 30s. 
I don't know if I still have Covid or if this is post viral inflammation and fatigue..There is no way of knowing as they are not testing community cases. Every doctor just says it's definitely Covid but I have no idea if I've passed the peak of the illness or if i should still be worried it could get worse. 
Just feel it's going on forever.
Be great to know if there's any non hospital stories of people being sick, as in still unable to do a thing this length of time. 
Thanks! "

I'm wondering if anyone's had similar experience.

This is the third time I've fallen ill with Covid .( within 9 monts)
I have 2 vaccinations( Phizer, the most recent one received Sep 21)
The first time I got infected was February this year while being on holiday in Tenerife. I was actually climbing mount Teide ( over 3000m) ,and i was feeling quite out of breath but i was sure it is just reaction to high altitude. When i came back to the UK i developed fatigue and headaches.Covid test was positive. Same for my husband. Symptoms weren't too bad and i continued working ( from home)
In May we travelled to Peru and Chile. whilst being in Cusco( altitude 3400) i started to feel very light headed and out of breath. I was taken to the hospital and was diagnosed with altitude sickness, given oxygen and medicine.But didn't get much better. Covid test at rhat point was negative .Arrived in Chile and immediately fell ill with a cold .I had fever,cough, headaches and positive Covid. Once i recovered from that i got a stomach issues .I couldn't eat anything, felt nauseous, fatigued .Have not been feeling very well since then.Last week we went to Ireland to friend's wedding and decided to extend this trip to do some climbing which we love. Straight after the wedding i had noticed a little bit itchy throat which i blamed on AC , I had covid twice this year so didn't even consider it. And it wasn't anything big. so we climbed the highest mountain in Ireland( only over 1000m) Then it started to get worse.Developed sore throat, difficulty breathing, extreme fatigue ,runny nose and couldn't sleep .Once back home, did the Covid test which came back positive. This time i can't work or do any simple tasks.Even walking to the toilet is difficult. 
My husband had negative test.
I'm 35 years old female. I'm not overweight ( I'm slightly underweight).
suffer from mild asthma,dust allergy. I do have anxiety and OCD also suffer from insomnia.
I have done some health checks and tests after the second COVID and they all came back ok.
But i feel that I'm getting weaker and keep catching viruses recently
Before Covid i have never had any viruses,colds or anything like it .
I understand that this is not a doctor's office, but maybe someone has had a similar experience?
thanks"

With the way the cases are here in England, I can only assume that I have contracted the BA.4 or BA.5 Omicron variant.

                            ","Hello all,

I was diagnosed with Covid in mid-August 2021. Overall, I had a fairly easy go of it. It took me a little over 3 weeks to test negative ( I only know this because my place of employment required me to submit a negative test to return to work). Anyway, while I was positive with the virus, my main symptoms were coughing fits, low-grade fever, fatigue, and feelings of anxiety.

Fast forward to now, I'm feeling absolutely horrible. I've had a headache around my left eyebrow/temple area every single day for over a month.  Sometimes it's minor and passes quickly, sometimes it's very debilitating and I'm bedridden with a pulsating headache for hours/days. But not a day has gone by where I haven't felt some pressure in my head. Also, occasionally I feel ""twitching"" in my legs, hands and fingers. Feels almost like I'm going to have an anxiety attack. 

If it's not a headache or twitching/anxiety bringing me down, it's extreme fatigue. My appetite is also random. Some days I'm not hungry at all and don't eat all day, other days I'm insatiable and can't stop eating. But I haven't had a 100% good day in months. 

Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, what are you doing to help alleviate these symptoms? I started taking magnesium oxide supplements for the headaches yesterday, hoping that takes effect soon. I also started drinking ginger tea a few days ago which seems to be helping with the anxiousness. Other than that, I spend most of my time laying in bed trying to relax and hoping I feel better... It's not fun.

Any advice someone can offer will be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance"

Mostly sinus congestion, fatigue, and anxiety/depression. The cycle still has not ended - today is 2/2/22 and still i have this horrible sensation in my throat/sinuses. It feels like severe inflammation or soreness. 4 doctor visits, 1 ER visit, and still no relief. 

I have taken steroids, antibiotics, zinc, nasal sprays, more vitamins than i can name here, antacids, and a slew of other failed meds and vitamins. I am at my wits end. 

The pain/discomfort seems to be a little better if I am laying down as opposed to standing upright or sitting. Rest helps a little - but i always end up back in the same boat. Doctor tells me my heart and lungs sounds good and that i have a ""little inflammation"" in my throat. It feels like i have a golf ball in there......

By way of background, I am a 28 year old male who contracted Covid back in October, along with my parents who are in their 60s. Thankfully all of our symptoms were mild similar to a seasonal cold and all recovered within around 10 days.

Over the last few days, I have been experiencing acute chest pains in my left side where my heart is. This has come on all of a sudden, prior to covid and even during and after being infected I never experienced this. 

The best way I can describe it is a feeling of sudden tension and throbbing around the heart, along with stabbing pains and some shooting pains in my left arm. I have booked a GP appointment as obviously this is slightly alarming, however I wanted to see if anyone else has experienced similar?

My dad who is in his 60s was affected with the exact same problem as myself, albeit a few weeks before.

I'm otherwise fit and healthy and to all intents and purposes this seems to have come out of nowhere. 

I'm curious to find out if anyone else has had similar experiences and would welcome feedback from your experiences.

I have been told by NHS consultants that chest pain and heart complications are some of the symptoms that have been identified post Covid, however there's not enough data available so it would be great to hear other people's experiences to hopefully generate a wider evidence base moving forward.

Thanks for reading and keep on moving forward!"

Around August 18th I started getting shortness of breath, cough and pain in the chest.  I went back to the doctor the end of August due to continued shortness of breath, lots of congestion and chest pain.  A chest X-ray was taken at that time, and I had Covid Pneumonia.  An EKG was performed and blood work was taken.  The EKG was normal and my blood work was normal.  The doctor advised me to do saline nasal rinses, take ibuprofen for pain, and monitor my oxygen with a pulse oximeter. 

I had a follow up doctor’s appointment a week ago.  I was prescribed antibiotics for my sinuses and they took another chest x-ray.  The antibiotics have helped clear up my sinus congestion.   The X-Ray showed no signs of Covid Pneumonia, but I still have a feeling of suffocation or a lump in my throat, chest pain, and I can barely sleep.

It's currently 5am on day 3, and the fever has been raging on, constantly. I've been taking at least 3 antipyretics a day because it's unbearable and it makes me extremely miserable, plus the weather here is already very hot. I've been alternating between ibuprofen and soluble paracetamol. Paracetamol works faster but seems to last a little bit less, it also contains a lot of sodium from what i know, ibuprofen takes forever to work (at least 40-50 minutes) but it seemed to last a bit longer, but I've also read it can be hard on the kidneys. I managed to fall asleep through the fever last night (which always peaks at 38.8-39.2), I've been taking my temperature using the oral route under the tongue, and I remember to add the extra 0.4-0.6c. However I woke up an hour ago and even though it kinda seemed to have dropped, it came back up in no time, I couldn't take it any more and took another ibuprofen (400mg). This one didn't seem to work as efficiently as it used to, it took about 50 minutes to work, and my temperature barely dropped below 39, I do feel comfortable enough though. Is it normal for a fever to be constant like this? I mean as soon as the meds start to wear off my temperature skyrockets immediately. This is my first time being infected this bad and I'm worried, I got it from my mother who doesn't have any fever at all. "

                            ","I've had Covid 3 times since December 2020 and now have an array of different post covid manifestations.

First, I now have Vertigo. It's a common post covid side effect. I was diagnosed with that a couple weeks after having it the first time and still have bouts of it but my Dr. prescribed Meclezine (spelling?) for that which helps greatly with the dizziness and nausea.

A week before I had it the first time I developed these lesions on my feet that looked like red angry blisters. They showed up between my fingers too. It was painful and there were/are days when I can't wear shoes. It disappeared after I recovered from Covid but then reappeared each time I had Covid again (which was 2 more times after the first time)...AND because I am autoimmune anyway, it pops up now when I so much as get the sniffles.

I also have this weird thing that happens to my face. It too happened a week before I had Covid the first time....and spontaneously happens ever since.

First my eyes will become blood shot. Then my face will turn a fiery red like I had been scalded and become so very hot. My face gets puffy...my eyes get puffy...And then the next day it's completely gone. BUT ...the weirdest thing is two weeks later my face will peel like I had literally been burned.

I also get these wicked headaches once in a while and still occasionally have a residual ""brain fog"". There are days too that I feel so fatigued I can barely keep my eyes open.

My Dr. is stumped. He doesn't know what is happening. Here in Tennessee though, Ivermectin is becoming available as an ""over the counter"" medication and I'm going to take it. I truly believe that Covid is still playing ""the mean girl"" inside of my body and the Ivermectin will (hopefully) get rid of it once and for all....If not, who knows how long I'll have to deal with this...

                            ","The only uplift I've had from long covid, was seeing someone else write about their experiences, and I was like, 'finally! someone else knows!' So I'm going to write my experiences and frustrations too, add them to the pile of stuff that's 'out there.' 

Since I got covid 4 months ago, I've never been right. I describe it as 'good days' and 'bad days'. For the first couple of months, I would swing between days of heavy-limbed tiredness, irritability, intense thirst and hunger, random headaches that can last all day... aand 'good days' where I was fairly symptom free. 

Toward the end of month 3, I had a week, one week of 'good days' and it reminded me what it's like to be me! That shot of regular life feeling was enough for me to really see the difference, it's like night and day. That week of good days was followed by two weeks of bad days, now there's barely a break in the clouds, and I gotta say the symptoms are getting worse. 

I'm 49, but through looks/energy/vibe, I've often been taken for being in my mid thirties. Now I feel like I'm in my frakkin' 60s >< 

My GP won't actually see me, because they're only taking emergency appointments, and have been for two years now. I called 111, and got a callback from a doctor, who easily diagnosed long covid, only to say I had to get a referral from my GP to the Long Covid Clinic.... which, ofc, I cannot do because my own GP won't take that kind of appointment. 

At my work, I asked for a reduction in hours. I worked a lot before, 40-50 hours per week... now it's more like 30-40 per week. But I'm still struggling. i asked for a further hours reduction, but I can't get it. At every level, they say dumb things: My manager, 'you sound like you want to leave.' Her boss: '40 hours goes with your job title, we've done all we can.' His boss, 'yes, let's get you to your GP to see if you're fit for work,' .... well.. that's something else I can't do >< ... aaaand, her boss from Head Office, 'things will seem better when the summer sun comes out.' 

I'm trying to cut down eeeevertying that takes effort, so that I can make it through these days, sometimes spending my whole weekend in bed, sleeping/napping/dozing... for the simple reason, that I can't move! I can sit in a chair, but it's .. head tips back, muslces are heavy, there's nothing I can do.... so I end up going back to bed! I arranged with my laundrette to deliver/pick up washing loads, so that I don't have to. The manager of the laundrette was interested in why I wanted this, and I told him about the long covid. He gave me a doubtful look. 

I'm draggging myself thru these days. I expected every day.. every week... that this would just clear up... I understand that people have reported 6 months or more, I get that its a marathon. But 4 months in, and the symptoms are getting worse. Now I'm hearing there are lots of people who have had this one or two years, and we  dont know if the effects are lifelong in some cases, because we've only got two years of examples to go on. 

I climb stairs every Friday morning, I work in a three storey building just on that particular day. Just as I get to the top, I cough, I always do, and I'm coughing up phlem. Proper, yellow/infected level of stuff is coming up. It's the only time I cough powerfully enough to bring stuff up from my lungs... but every week, without fail, I'm getting this sign of infection from my lungs! What is that about!? How can I have a live infection, week after week like that? 

There's always an extra drain on my system, I can feel it, adding weight to my limbs, tightening my chest, making my breath and body labour over simply walking, or any kind of activity that was once so easy that the effects of it wouldn't even register on my awareness. Now they leave me worn out. 

Even on good days, I'm massively conscious not to overdo things. I've tried exercise to get my body toward fitness quicker, but it takes an entire week to recover from that. Good day + too much activity = loooong string of bad days afterwards. 

It's almost intolerable, and yet everyone reacts with shrugs or disbelief. I'm glad there's something of a community for this, damn,  finally sane responses!

My wife has been struggling with a variety of symptoms ever since receiving the second Pfizer vaccine (October 2021), again after testing positive to Covid (Jan 2022), and again after being a close contact to Covid in April 2022 . Symptoms range from, but usually start in this order on a daily basis;
- Leg pain (thigh area, like an electric shock, feels neurological)
- Dry eyes, mouth and throat.
- All over body aches
- Sore head, like she's been hit across the head.
- Nausea usually in the evenings, but has happened on occasion in the morning.
- Also some feelings of nearly passing out.

Any kind of physical exertion usually worsens symptoms. She constantly needs to rest. Has had every blood test and heart test you can think of. Currently waiting for an appointment with an infections disease doctor. But so far no doctors can help her. She has to manage it on her own with paracetamol and rest.

Any help or ideas on what avenues we should explore would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you!"

I can't find any articles saying if this is permanent, or if this is something that will subside as my symptoms begin to go away, or if this is just a symptom due to Covid and not a form of Covid induced ED.

She experienced some rather common symptoms: Mild fever, cough and so on. But on day 5 she lost her sense of smell/taste and around that time she also got this strange sensation in the head.

She is having a hard time describing how it feels, but it is very unpleasant and persistent. It's not a headache as such. She describes it as the feeling of electricity going through her brain. She says she feels almost a bit drunk, and I guess it can be best described as a strange kind of migraine.

Painkillers and NSAIDs seem to make no difference. Caffeine/coffee makes no difference (maybe a bit for the worse). Warm baths make no difference. Walks and fresh air makes no difference (maybe momentarily for the worse). We have also tried e.g. ginger, zinc and Q10 but the symptoms remain the same (but maybe such supplements needs a longer period).

She sleeps well and is able to chat, laugh and perform daily tasks without showing any lack of coordination or competence. But she complains that the feeling in the head is constant, intensely uncomfortable and seemingly unchanging. She says that it's much worse than having a headache and she is willing to do anything to make it stop.

Have anyone experienced something similar? Any recommendations for remedies to try?"

Whenever I tell people that this is what I do, they always look at me with eyes that I can see are diagnosing me with OCD. My motivation to continue with these precautions however has come from a number of things. 

1: I can’t be vaccinated in spite of desperately wanting to be. 

2: I have bronchiectasis, so therefore am especially susceptible to the virus. 

3: I am immunocompromised. 

I’ve been reading articles saying that it’s no longer necessary to disinfect your shopping; however, in the same breath, these articles that claim to be channelling science also state the importance of hand-washing before and after handling groceries you’ve just purchased. Surely if that’s what the science is saying, it’s also indicating that it’s important to thoroughly clean the items that are making it necessary for you to wash your hands? Surely if the shopping’s dirty enough to make hand-washing a requirement after touching it, it’s dirty enough to requiring cleaning itself? 

Also, while the hygiene requirements of shop workers is considered in the scientific findings, what about other factors that could potentially contaminate your food? Would a considered factor be...the lady who walks off the bus with her child, only to then pick them up and stand them in a shopping trolly to walk all over the area your shopping touches in the shoes they’ve walked through vomit and canine excrement in?

It was so sensitive, I was not able to wear a shirt or lie down to sleep (slept in a chair).   When the other symptoms (fever, muscle pain, joint pain) began to intensify on days 2 and 3, I started to take extra strength Tylenol (aspirin is contraindicated for me).  Within 30 mins of taking 2 of the Tylenol, the sensitivity was gone.  Unfortunately, like clockwork, when the 8 hour dose of Tylenol ran out, the sensitivity returned just as strong as before.  I am now on day 7 - and - although the other symptoms have rapidly dissipated (using the I-mask+ protocol), the skin issues continue unabated.  I have done some research and found this to be a relatively rare symptom of COVID that sometimes spontaneously resolve without treatment - but I have seen no discussion about how to treat this symptom while it persists.  At least for me, the answer is: Extra Strength Tylenol every 8 hours."

My boyfriend tested positive for covid (he is symptomatic) last Sunday (1/16). I have tested everyday since and am still negative. We live in the same house, sleep in the same bed and I have not exactly been ""distanced"" from each other. The previous Friday we were with three other people, all of them tested positive as well (assuming we had a server, bartender or were all around the same person that had it). This is not the first time this has happened for me. I have been around at least 10 other people throughout the pandemic that I have later learned, tested positive. I am sure the vaccine has definitely assisted my immune system in fighting off the virus. 

Another strange coincidence (or not), is that my brother's girlfriend also contracted the virus and he never got it either. 

My question here is, should I assume I have some sort of built-up immunity or antibodies? Maybe I have already had covid without knowing. Is there somewhere in particular that I could donate my blood for research? I would love to do that if anyone knows of anywhere that I could do so. I'm guessing if I do not have the antibodies, maybe something in particular in my DNA or my blood type?

Thank you for any assistance,
Kathryn"

My body temperature drops as low as 90° Fahrenheit sometimes and during this time I start to lose consciousness. My body feels lethargic, I have high blood pressure and eventually I start sweating. All this episode takes 10-20 minutes, sometimes even longer. This happens post exertion as well as when I’m resting or taking a nap. Indications of these episodes are sweating, dizziness, body ache, and trepidation.

This has affected my lifestyle immensely. I’m only 18 years old. I had these episodes during my final exams as well. I’m also experiencing loss of appetite. Eating heavy or fried foods also cause these episodes. The only thing that helps out is a strong black tea or consuming warm milk or water.

We’ve conducted each and very body test possible, been to numerous doctors and no core problem was ruled out. Basic medication to improve immune system and some antibiotics were prescribed each time and none of it improved my situation. I want to know if anybody else has dealt with a situation like this?

For the last 3 weeks I have been testing positive on lateral flow tests. Faint lines, but definitely there. I've done 9 positive lateral flow tests in total and taken 3 PCR tests over this time, all of which came back negative.
To my knowledge I've been lucky enough to completely avoid catching covid so far (touch wood) so I don't think it's something residual hanging on from having had it before, and even if it was and I was just unaware, surely the PCR tests would pick it up?
The lateral flow tests I am continuously testing positive on are the new Flowflex ones. And no, I haven't had any lemon juice before taking them! (I hear that causes false positives!)
I can't find much on the Internet to say other people are experiencing this. I have no symptoms of covid and I'm certain I don't currently have it. 
I also don't think it's a dodgy batch of Flowflex tests either, because my husband has used the same ones with a clear negative result.
Am I just defective or is anyone else having the same trouble?

                            ","I am writing this to talk about COVID-19 vaccinations and why I think everyone should get vaccinated. Personally, I think it is just the responsible thing to do because it not only helps protect you but it also protects those around you. I think people should do it just to look out for their loved ones. Although I understand people do not agree and believe it is unsafe. That is what I am planning to discuss. 
People’s fear of the vaccine- that being that it came out too fast and is unsafe- is very understandable; I’m not going to lie, I was very skeptical of it at the beginning. When it first became available to people, I was thinking the same thing I’m sure a lot of people were thinking, such as: how do we know this is safe? It came out way too fast, there is no way they were able to do enough tests on this, they don’t know what the long term effects of this could be. After reading many non-biased and trustworthy articles over the vaccine, I do now believe it is safe and I think everyone should be receiving it. First off, scientists have been working on creating a SARS-CoV vaccine for more than 50 years meaning they have existing data on the structure, genome, and life cycle of this type of virus. In order to create the vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), scientists only had to manipulate the S-protein of the SARS-CoV vaccine. Since time was a luxury the world could not afford, scientists all over the world came together to create the COVID-19 vaccine as quickly and safely as possible. Being able to all compare their research on SARS-CoV, made it easier for them to come up with a safe vaccine for that, therefore leading to creating the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. 
Since scientists have been able to do research and conduct testing SARS-CoV vaccines for the past many years, I believe it shows us that this COVID-19 vaccine actually did not come out too fast. It is the same virus as SARS-CoV, it just has a different S-protein strand which was easy for scientists to manipulate. I truly do believe this vaccine is safe and it is the only way we will be able to get past this. If you believe you’ll be fine if you get the virus because you’re young and healthy then think about others for a second. Sure, you may be fine and it may not affect you,  but it will/has affect those around you. We have lost 5.2 million people worldwide to this disease. We need to do everything in our power to stop this disease, and that requires thinking of others before yourself and getting vaccinated.

For the past couple of years I've enjoyed a beer or two after work every couple of days. 

I would drink like I normally do, with no side effects at all. I would always moderate myself and not drink more than 2 beers a day every 2-3 days. 

Last month, I tested positive for Covid-19, lost my smell and taste and felt ill over a week but got back on my feet with a bit of fatigue here and there and I thought I got away scot - free. 

That was until I drunk a beer a week after I got better and instantly started sneezing, coughing and suffered from a runny nose for two days. I didn't think much of it and continued to drink here and there with the exact same symptoms lingering on for 2 days. 

I don't have any food allergies I know of. Ive always enjoyed food with nothing to worry about. 

To this day, a month on I can't happily drink beer without a consistent cough, runny nose and sneezing. 

I believe this might have to do with covid because the day before I tested positive and felt a bit off, I had a beer with no symptoms. 

Does anyone know what might have caused this new allergy/intolerance or what it might be? 

I appreciate anyone who takes the time read and respond

My mother has been in hospital for almost three weeks (with pneumonia after being diognised with covid 19) and there seems to be no progress with regards to her breathing abilities - she is still using an oxygen mask and finds it quite difficult to breathe without it. She seems to be losing strength, with limited abilities to even drink water on her own. She is  basically lying in bed all day. Do you think that it´s necessary for her to try to move so that her lungs increase their capacity? It´s surprising to me that doctors still have not mentioned anything about rehabilitation.

However, I feel maybe I will get a more sympathetic response here. I live in Bristol England in case that’s relevant.
January 2020 my 18 year old daughter was very sick with a constant - every few seconds cough that lasted for days. She hardly ever gets sick. She had a mild fever and had fatigue. My son and I had very mild flu like symptoms. Since then I have had various random symptoms. A really scary episode where my vision and balance went crazy for a few hours followed by quite a few more milder episodes. Shaking and kind of spasms occasionally. My neighbour who I hang out with was taken to hospital a few months later and put on oxygen despite testing negative for COVID 3 times.
A a few months later I had a few days of feeling poorly with more dizzy spells I took a COVID test. Later that day I got the first nosebleed I have ever had. We all assumed I had irritated my nostril with the swab. Result was negative. The nosebleeds became so extreme it was coming out my eyes and I was in A &E many times and eventually admitted as an in patient and ‘fixed’ in the most painful way.
When my daughter went to her first year at Leeds university she had the same kind of episode of illness she had had previously but perhaps more cold like symptoms but still the cough. That week everyone in her tower block were testing positive for COVID.
A month or two ago I went to see my daughter in Leeds as she was experiencing the same kind of illness only this time she had obviously developed tonsillitis and conjunctivitis alongside the coughing /sore throat. Her flatmates were also poorly but not so bad. After staying with her for two days after not having nosebleeds for months I suddenly got one out of the blue and they escalated in severity again. Leeds student accommodation then suddenly became one of the hot spots of covid with flat mate testing positive. The flatmate was one who hadn’t tested positive previously.
Now in Bristol which has recently become a hotspot my neighbour suddenly had uncontrollable shaking followed by a temperature (39.5) but unusually cold hands. His oxygen level was 95. He felt generally unwell and tired but recovered after 24 hours, apart from a very swollen foot. He had been double vaccinated as have I. He had recently played table tennis at a community centre where my friend’s son has just had to isolate as his team leaders had tested positive after playing table tennis in the same room. My neighbour tested negative 3 times. I just had an episode of sudden hot ear and then cheek for a few hours and felt pretty tired. On the same side as my nosebleeds. My children had a weird reoccurrence of mild eczema.
Is this all just coincidence? I’m wondering if we are possibly catching covid again and again - every time our bodies come into contact with it it is doing it’s best to fight it off and thankfully for my family and friends it seems the symptoms are reducing - possibly due to immunity and vaccinations.
I apologise for this long message but I haven’t seen anyone that has been experiencing anything similar and am just really interested if anyone has similar stories of being exposed to covid again and having symptoms and yet testing negative possibly because our bodies are doing so well at fighting it off we don’t have enough virus in us to test positive.

My husband had his first Covid vaccine back in April and he had the AstraZeneca vaccine.

He was extremely poorly for about 5 days with it, he was struggling with breathing, awful fever, vomiting, unable to eat, not sleeping, struggling to drink and severe aching. We did contact the doctor as he never moans about illness's but he was really really bad with this and the doctor said over the phone this was normal and he would be fine in a week.

He had to cancel all his jobs he had booked in as he couldn't move which hit us financially again after the lockdown. He refused to get his 2nd jab after the way he felt.

I am desperate for him to get his 2nd jab and he said he will only go ahead if its the Phizer vaccine. I have tried to ring up to see if its too late for him to have his 2nd jab and is it possible to have the Phizer but they didn't really know if it was too late. They said they think the 1st jab has probably expired by now and to contact the doctor. I have tried to get a telephone appointment with the doctor but they are refusing to book and appointment and asked me to ring the Covid line but they are asking me to ring the doctor....no one will speak to me and i'm worried with all the cases at the moment, if he gets Covid i will lose him!

Does anyone have any advice if its too late to get a 2nd dose nearly 6 months after the 1st jab?

Or, will they give him a 1st jab again and then a 2nd jab?

Is it possible to have Phizer if he didn't have that the first time as he can't have that again?

Thank you all x"

I just wanted clarification that spending at least 10 days in an amber zone country means you are treated in the UK as such? i.e. coming directly from a red zone country means you must quarantine in a hotel on your return to the UK but coming from an Amber zone country doesn't have this requirement.

                            ","Hello,

I have just completed the 10 days isolation after having tested positive for covid.

At the time I was abroad so I extended my stay there to complete the isolation period.
I then wanted to travel back to the UK where I live, from all the information I found online it seems that after having tested positive, future PCR tests can still show up as positive for up to 3 months.

When arriving at the Eurostar to travel back to the UK, they would not let me through without a negative test even after explaining the situation, and showing proof by my doctor that I tested positive and completed the isolation period and have no symptoms.

They then told me to do a quick test in a pharmacy in the train station and somehow (I have no idea how) the result was negative, without this they would not let me travel back to the UK at all.

Which to me seems they didn't think through this kind of situation...

Now before being allowed on the train I also had to book the day 2 and day 8 PCR test (hasn't been 2 weeks since my second dose yet) so now back in the UK I have to complete 2 more test and I'm very aware that these could show up positive again... resulting in being seen as a new infection while it obviously wouldn't be.

To me this makes no sense, I called NHS multiple times and it seems like everybody just has no idea themselves.
I was wondering if anybody has been in a similar situation?

Another question I have, on the NHS app it says as one of the 4 reasons to get a NHS COVID Pass:

'Natural immunity
If you've previously tested positive for COVID-19 using a PCR test, and it's been at least 10 days since your positive result, you are eligible for an NHS COVID Pass for up to 180 days from the test date.'

Now it's been over 10 days and this hasn't showed up, I called NHS about this and it even seems like thre is no record of my postive test on my profile... 
How do I get this NHS COVID pass after having tested positive?

Sorry for the long message, really hope to get some help :)

Have a nice day"

Early June 2021, I tested Covid negative.


Starting around July 10, 2021, I stopped wearing a mask in public, as everyone around me seemed to have stopped too.

Around July 15, 2021, I started feeling some symptoms I thought were related to a cold.  Mild cold sweats, inability to get to sleep easily at night, but no fatigue - I continued to go to the gym and exercise hard during this period.

July 17, 2021, I felt some cold sweats during the day, tiny bit of solid phlegm coughed up, very mild cough.

July 20, 2021, I tested Covid positive.


My wife has had similar mild symptoms, starting round July 20, 2021, although she has had no cough, no phlegm, but yes runny nose .  (I have not had a runny nose at all.)  She too has experienced no fatigue.  Must assume that I gave her the Covid, as she has been in contact with no one other than me during this period.  I am the only one who has been leaving the house during this period.  She hasn't yet actually tested positive, but assume that she has it.

We will both go for a follow up test next week.


My sense of smell and taste not affected.

Her sense of smell only affected, but she thinks it might just be due to nasal congestion.

No fever at any point - my temperature has been around 97.5 F which is normal for me; hers around 98.1 F which is normal for her.

We have isolated and are avoiding contact with anyone since July 18, 2021, other than when I went to take the test July 20th.

We both feel mild mild dizziness if we exert ourselves, similar to trying to exercise with a bacterial cold.


Trying to just rest, eat well, plenty of fluids.  Wet sauna / steam room at home to try to sweat the virus out."

I rang track and trace and they told me to isolate for 10 days from the first positive test, I then ordered another home PCR test and sent that away on thursday and got my results today and again negative, but i've had 6 positive lateral flow tests and they're all from different boxes because i had suspicions that maybe it was a dodgy box or something.

I'm 40M and totally devastated at the moment due to debilitating symptoms that started 3 weeks post covid infection (tested positive on 10/6/21). My initial Covid symptoms were moderate (treated at home) and I didn't get any breathing/lungs problems. However, I had severe stomach pain, diarrhea, nausea and appetite loss. These symptoms improved overtime but then I developed new set of symptoms: occasional blood in stool, occasional burning stomach after eating, extreme lightheadedness/dizziness/feeling woozy (ESPECIALLY AFTER EATING), extreme hair loss, tinnitus, light sensitivity (can't stand bright sun light), blurry vision and tingling/itching head. I went on and got many tests done:

- MRI brain scan. Normal
- CBC (WBC, RBC). Normal (hemoglobin normal)
- Inflammation markers (CRP; ESR; D-dimer; Ferritin). Normal

- 24-Hour blood pressure monitoring. Systolic blood presure ranges between 100-130 (ave. 103) & Diastolic blood pressure ranges beteeen 58-80 (ave. 60). It seems my Diastolic bloop pressure is sometimes borderline low.

- Blood sugar. Ranges between 4-6 on most times. However, I tend to get low blood sugar problems including lightheadedness even when numbers are normal?

- Kidney function (Creatinine; Sodium; Potassium; Chloride). Within normal range

- Cortisol. Not tested

- Liver Enzymes (AST; ALT; Albumin). Normal
- Heart rate monitor. Had tachycardia during the first month post covid but now it's in the 65-85 range.
- Zinc level. Normal
- Serum iron. Currently normal (was low 3 weeks ago)
- Calcium level: Normal

- SaO2. 98%-100%
- Upper Endoscopy for stomach + duodenum. Unremarkable & no indication of H. pylori
- H-Pylori breathing test. Negative
- Ear balance test. Normal
- Coagulation test. normal

Like I said,  extreme lightheadedness/dizziness/feeling woozy is my worst symptom and it gets 10x after eating. 

Question:
Can gastritis cause lightheadedness? could it be blood circulation problem leading to less blood flow the brain? Are eye sensitivity to light and tingling head related to decreased blood flow? should I go for colonoscopy to rule out ulcers and other abnormalities? Are there any other necessary tests? 

Is there anyone who had similar experience? is there a solution? I'm suffering everyday :(

She recommended I hold off on getting vaccinated because she said the vaccine could make me feel really sick since my antibodies were already high. I recently got a second antibody test, which said my IgG antibody level is now 250. My Dr said she has never seen anyone’s level increase and she had no idea why it would. She said 250 is really high, and that the level for someone who has been vaccinated is usually over 100.

I had no immediate allergic reaction to it. By Saturday's early morning I woke up with a fever, so I took paracetamol, later in the day fever came back so I took another pill and so on and so forth, took 3 pills in total.

By Saturday afternoon I noticed 2 spots on my leg and my stomach that appeared to be an allergic reaction, or maybe bug bites, they have since disappeared.

On Sunday I noticed 2 new spots near my vaccination spot on my left arm, along with other smaller spots I guess are called hives. The spots are itchy but mostly on contact.

I also noticed something very weird since it had never happened to me before, some kind of white spots that look like something dried up, at first it made me think of dried yogurt, but obviously it's not the case, they aren't itchy or painful, and one of them actually was removed with water gentle rubbing.

Is this a reaction to the vaccine? I'm not sure if I should see a doctor for this or if it's even related to the vaccine, but I have not eaten or been in contact with anything new either.

Tuesday my cold continued - just sneezing and runny nose - nothing else. My boss said - do a lateral flow just to be on the safe side - it came up positive!!!

went home inmediately. did another and also positive.

wednesday had runny nose and sneezing all day. felt absokutelt fine. by 5pmish all my sense of taste and smell gone. great!

wake up today and still positive on lateral flow. nose no longer runny - just a bit blocked. sneezing now and again. but i cant taste or smell anything.

im still in shock i have covid after vaccine. i feel so guilty - obviously off work for sometime now but i feel absolutely fine. obviously i will obey all rules. guessing it hasnt hit me as much because of vaccines. just i know ive been to work with worst colds.

my question is - anyone else had covid as light touch as this? do tou know how long it took to be clear?

how long does this awful loss of taste and smell last for.  i feel completely fit and well except for sneezing and this lack of smell / taste.

started Saturday with sneezes so guessing i would have tested positive then. so... this would be day six for me.

For some context, I'm a mid/late thirties male, I don't have any known health issues, I have a healthy BMI and have always maintained an exercise regimen (mostly running 3 times a week) to stay reasonably fit. I don't smoke and very rarely drink. I have never had any cardio health issues.

I had my first shot of the Pfizer vaccine almost 8 weeks ago and it went well- I basically had no symptoms that I can recall. My arm didn't even get sore- the only time I would feel pain in my arm is if I fully extended it in front me, and even then it was very mild. I think I was a bit ""fatigued"" at the end of the same day- but I'm not even sure that it was a result of the vaccine. I do suffer from intermittent bouts of insomnia which may have caused it; not sure. The fatigue didn't have ""different feel"" about it.

So essentially what I'm asking is- can I ""estimate"" how my body will react to the second dose, given how it reacted to first dose? Since my body reacted ""well"" to the first dose (no problems)- do I have a ""better"" chance at having no adverse reactions (i.e. heart inflammation) when I get my second dose?"

2- Did clots produce due to COVID or ARDS?

I am from Holland and I am looking for some information and reassurance. In my own country I can't seem to find any information.

Currently, the Astrazeneca, J&J, Pfizer and Moderna vaccine are widely discussed in the news. These could potentially have rare side effects and cause clots and low platelets. 

I have had severe HELLP syndrome. This is also a rare serious disease that occurs in only 02, up to 0.6 percent of all pregnant women and also causes low platelets and clots. My body is therefore certainly able to cause this immune response, partly by non-body substances (half of the DNA is from the partner). This is something I never hope to experience again. And I am now terribly afraid of being vaccinated with 1 of these vaccines. Although I would very much like this partly because I belong to the risk group with asthma. 

Are there any women here who have had pre-eclampsia or HELLP syndrome who have already been vaccinated? And have you experienced any side effects?"

I have seen the doc who believes the red patch is a late reaction to the vaccine and the lower lymph node he says he believes is a tendon not a node. He said he will refer me for a scan on the other node just to make sure. 
Did anyone else get enlarged lymph nodes after their vaccine, more than a week later?

In the mid of 2019 I started having very cold hands before lunch time that I can't work. I went to do blood test and I was asked to take vitamins which didn't do any change.

Then In had the symptoms of corona in the 23 of march 2020,
* 1st day: Shivering, headache, diarrhea, couldn't eat
* 2nd day: sorethroat at mid day, couldn't eat
* 3rd day: started eating, sorethroat ended at mid day, blocked nose at night with lump in throat (solved the blocked nose with spray o.w I wouldn't breath)
* 4th day: same as 3rd day

I wasn't eligible for test so I had to stay only at home. After these 4 days and I started feeling progress, then I suddenly noticed 
* breathing problems after lunch only. 
* A lot of burping, 
* dead skin around my nose 
* needles feeling in my chest
* Frequent red itchy skin at the lymphoid gland area as well as red itchy skin on the esophagus area
* Can't talk a lot or shout as I feel sensitive in my throat


In June my esophagus was so inflamed that after touching the area of lymphoid gland, I had a fast heart beat and I went to do corona test which came negative. I went to the doctor who doubted that I have reflux and after trying Proton pump inhibitors for two weeks nothing changed and then he asked me to do a spectroscopy and we found nothing. Strangely that I found a friend of a friend that had the same symptoms but she even had blood coming from her throat. She did the spectroscopy and found that it was Helicobacter Pylori is the reason. My doctor simply told me, don't be scared because it seems to be a psychological problem.


I read online to see life habits to decrease the effect of reflux and what really made a difference was to avoid sitting in the bed before sleeping. That removed the most harsh symptom of breathing problems after lunch. Yet I went on with a lot of burping, daily dead skin around my nose and needles feeling in my chest and around every 3 weeks to have red itchy skin over lymphoid and esophagus.


Now that a year has passed and I am still having the same symptoms plus frequent numbness in the back of my feet and my feet nails is getting destroyed.  I have read in a publication that Helicobacter pylori bacteria increases the ace 2 receptors which covid19  use as a host cell and another paper today that Helicobacter pylori is the reason behind lymphoid gland problems. 


Does anyone facing the same problems or something similar, know any extra information that I might be missing or have advice?

However my arm didn't hurt as much although it did hurt.  I did feel a very slight case of chills that night.   I also felt aches and pains the next day and my arm was swollen.  I took 2 tylenol every 6 hours for a total of 4 times.  On the last dose, my arm pain almost completely disappeared and I pretty much felt back to normal about 28 hours after receiving the 2nd dose.

Not bad and certainly not as bad as some vaccine reaction stories I've hear from others.  I would also say that my experience seems to confirm that the 2nd dose can elicit a bit more or stronger reactions than the 1st dose.

GET THE VACCINE AS SOON AS YOU CAN!  I feel relieved now that I've had my 2nd dose and glad that I will be contributing to achieving herd immunity."

I have come to the conclusion its my brain substituting this smell / taste instead of what the smells and tastes should be. When I go into another room my brain thinks there should be a new smell here so I get a big smell of the chicken thighs and every time I eat its the same smell and taste.

Has anyone else had this symptom. I'm only guessing its from Corona.

Any in site into this would be appreciated.

Would you like to help us understand this issue better by taking part in a study led by the University of Hertfordshire?
We are investigating why some people are finding it difficult to adjust to the easing of pandemic restrictions. Participation would involve completing a brief online survey with questions relating to coping and thinking styles. The results of this research will inform further research and support interventions in the field of mental health in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic.

My husband works at IT, he got his first dose of the vaccine, as did I, and we are waiting for our 2nd. (I am a stay at home mother.) We have a 4 year old daughter and an almost 1 year old who has an SVT since 2 months old. 

We have been practically in a bubble. My husband works (masks required) and we do get groceries once a month (usually we do grocery pick up but we are on WIC so we do stop once a month to get WIC items.) The only people we have seen since this all began are my parents, who take it VERY serious, and my SIL, who also does.

My parents have been fully vaccinated (yay) now, but now that they have been, my sisters family will be visiting them every now and then. My sister's family does not take it serious at all, refuses to vaccinate or wear masks or social distance. 

We know that there IS a possibility of spreading it even after being fully vaccinated, so we aren't sure how long we should stay away from my parents when they visit my sisters family. 

I talked to her pediatrician and she had said it was ""up to us"" on how we felt.. either wait 2 weeks, or wait a week and see if they have symptoms. 

The WIC clinic told me that it was ""very rare for someone vaccinated to pass it on"" and that we ""probably didn't have to worry"". 

But others have told me not to risk it and do a full 2 week of distancing from them. 

So I'm confused now. It'll be a week, Saturday, since my parents have seen my sisters family. They have some health problems  unrelated to covid (they both had had covid tests before this as they have had to go to the hospitals a few times for testing to see what's going on) but they have no covid symptoms. 

Should we still quarantine another week with no contact, should we see them but have them wear masks (they have said they would if we wanted them to), or is it safe enough, since they are fully vaccinated and have been very careful for a week with no symptoms, to see them?

I know covid isn't as likely to be dangerous for children, but since our daughter had a heart condition (which we can thankfully say she has not had an episode since October now! but back in June-July it spiked her heart rate due to a simple fever she got) we have been scared to let anyone near the household. 

My parents are our only outlet, so we're hoping we will be able to see them sooner, but I will do whatever is safest for our kids too."

I quarantined for 2 weeks although the CDC recommends a minimum of 10 days from the first day of symptoms for people who test positive. I am 35 in decent health and my symptons were minor aches and fever for about the first 3-4 days with slight dizziness and headaches off and on for about 7-8 days. I have been feeling normal for more than a week.

However, my issue is that today I was at a friends to look at a window that needs a blind repaired. When I was leaving we talked for a few minutes and I mentioned that I had tested positive but had also quarantined for the 14 days instead of the 10 recommended by the CDC. Unfortunately she was very upset that I even came by and didn't tell her first. She was also bothered that I would even be out in the first place. I did wear a mask the entire time and maintained distance as well. She is only around 30 years old although she has had some health problems.

I am not really sure what to do or how to respond to all of her angry texts that she has been sending me from panic even though I explained that I was careful to quarantine for longer than required and also that I am feeling fine. Honestly I feel that we won't return to normal for a long time and that people won't trust anyone again.

                            ","mRNA vaccines work by providing the genetic code for our cells to produce viral proteins. Once the proteins, which don’t cause disease, are produced, the body launches an immune response against the virus, enabling the person to develop immunity.

Question 1: the proteins are produced by cells that presumably go on to replicate, with the mRNA changes incorporated in their replications. Then the replicated cells produce more viral proteins, which our immune system will presumably attack. What happens when the number of modified cells is producing enough viral protein to overwhelm the immune system?

Question 2: Why does the body launch an immune response to something that is produced by our cells? Why does it not recognise that the viral proteins are produced internally, and so should not be attacked?

Question 3: If the immune system is attacking viral protein, what will it do when it sees, not just the “spike”, but the whole virus?

Question 4: What will happen when someone who has had the vaccine, and so is producing viral protein, is trying to conceive a child with someone who hasn’t had the vaccine, so may recognise the other person’s sex cells as “foreign” and attack them?

It had never happened before and I didn't hurt myself or anything like that. Then I also started experiencing a slight feeling of warmth, not really on the whole leg but my foot feels warm.

Minutes later I also felt another jolt of pain close to the arch my foot.

A week ago I  had a couple of blood tests to check for anything odd, my D Dimer levels were both times within range, and it actually went down by a single digit the second time. My doctor checked it all and said they were fine and since they weren't increasing it wasn't a problem.

I don't notice any swelling so far and the leg isn't painful to the touch, I actually haven't felt the pain since that one time. Although it does feel slightly weird, like loose but not really, and like I said the calf isn't painful any more.

Thought I would pop on here to share my experience of Covid. I'll bulletpoint to keep it simple. 

*14th&15th Dec, I was in contact with someone who tested positive for covid (they tested positive on the 16th)
*21st Dec - experienced sharp shooting pains all over my body - not constant and did not interfere with daily activities. 
* 23rd Dec - feeling extremely tired but didn't interfere with daily activities, minor loss of taste. 
* 24th Dec - still tired, sharp pains gone. Felt like I had small blobs of phlegm stuck in my throat - not low enough to cough up and not high enough to blow out nose.  Not very hungry.
* 25th Dec - the person I was in contact with passed away. (he DID have numerous underlying health conditions and sepsis from a UTI). Ability to smell and taste things 90% gone.
* 28th Dec - go for a test. Feeling tired and breathless - this was thankfully minor and manageable. OK when I sit in the warm. 
* 29th Dec - Positive result. I felt so so scared. I live in a with my Fiance and his mum. We are all in separate rooms - isolating. Never felt so alone and scared. 
* 30th Dec to 2nd Jan - every night, going to bed anxious. Scared of getting worse, scared incase I have the same fate as the friend we lost. Weird dreams about food and craving food! Taste and smell came back over these days to about 80%. Breathlessness getting better but still taking it easy and listening to my body. 
* 3rd Jan - developed 1 patch of rash. The 'Herald spot' for pityriasis rosea (confirmed by a DR)
* Recovering day by day. 

21/01/21 - I am back at work as of a couple weeks ago. Still feel like I have hayfever every now and then. Managed to go for a small run last weekend (Usually run 5k at least twice a week) - went better than I thought. I still have the rash and the sharp shooting pains have come back and bite every now and then. 

I must admit the worst experience of it all for me was the anxiety that came with it. You only hear and see negatives on the news and after my friend passing, it was really hard to think I would get off lightly. 

I'm still not 100% but I am hoping that as time goes by, I will gradually get back to my normal self. Time will tell I guess. 

If anyone wants to ask me anything etc, please let me know. Happy to help anyone if I can from my experience.

For those who have also experienced or are currently experiencing the same thing, it's terrifying and confusing but more so if you're a bit of a comfort eater and love the taste of food. My self isolation period ends on Wednesday next week. Can somebody please tell me how long it'll take for my senses to return or if they never will? That's the thing I'm so scared about and it's sort of made my anxiety and depression much worse than it normally is! Many thanks in advance."

My doctor said I might or might not be able to have it which is not helpful. Has anyone else with allergies had the vaccine and felt OK with it? I would also urge anyone on here who has long Covid to look up ME/CFS as the symptoms are very similar and you might find things such as pacing, setting very small goals, diet, supplements, etc  to be helpful in seeing an improvement in your symptoms."

But since Wednesday I started getting headaches that I believe have gotten stronger, the first 2 days they happened during the afternoon, today it started shortly after waking up.

Earlier today I also noticed a sudden nasal discharge, clear liquid, coming out of both sides for a moment, although I want to believe it was due to the food I had just eaten.

Could this be due to some kind of brain inflammation? Or due to recent physical or sexual activity since this is how the first headache started?

Or is this all just a coincidence?"

Im a nursery teacher and am currently waiting on the results of a covid test to see if i have it.

My symptoms started with a terrible sore throat then progressing to tiredness and a ridiculous amount of sneezing and nasal congestion.

I have suffered mild body aches and nausea with has led to me not really wanting to eat much. 
Just as of today (day 3) I have noticed a change in my sense of smell however i can still taste fine.

Could easily be a cold as i have suffered no cough and my temperature at its highest was only 37.4 which is very low grade.

Just wondered if this is what other people experienced with mild covid or if its more likely a cold as the wait to find out is driving me insane!

                            ","So I should be on day 14 since symptoms onset today, and while I feel like I did experience every single symptom there is, I never experienced shortness of breath, at least I think so.

I had my second blood tests done yesterday which confirmed DDimer and Fibrinogen levels are still or went back into their appropriate ranges, C-Reactive Protein went down almost within its range as well. So far Ferritin is the only one that has gone up, up to twice its max value actually, currently at **500.61 ng/ml**, max should be about 275, 3 days before it was at **338.5 ng/ml **  so that's a significant increase too as far as I can tell. I haven't heard back from my doctor yet. But as far as I've seen this goes up when there is immune system hyper inflammation, which can cause serious problems.

Since last night and until today I have felt as if my chest is heavier than usual, if I try a deep breath it feels as if I have something on me causing pressure, or like very tight constricting clothing. 

My blood oxygen levels are normal, they range between 98% - 100%. Everytime I have been checked out by my doctor I have no problem reaching 100% either. 

Blood pressure is also fine, heart beat rate is fine, 60 - 90 depending on the situation.

So my question is, since most markers are fine, except for that one, could this be considered a bad indicator? Is this really what shortness of breath feels like?  Or just some anxiety induced fear symptom that I'm getting?

I feel like it would be too easy to blame it on axiety, especially since the risk is real given that most Covid related deaths happen in the immune response stage I'm in."

I no longer have a fever or headaches and my taste is back along with most of my smell. Basically the only symptom is that I keep coughing every now and then. All in all I feel fine.

I should be on day 11 since symptoms onset this Sunday, and on Saturday, day 10, my doctor had me do some blood tests to see how I'm doing internally.

We reviewed them today and they weren't very good. I had high fibrinogen levels (634.3 mg/dL, range should be 250-600), high ferritin levels (338.5 ng/ml, range should be 21-274), high globular sedimentation rate (31 mm/hr, range should be 0-15), highC-Reactive Protein (1.31 mg/dL, range should be 0-0.5), among other values.

Dimer-D was high but within range (245 ng/ml, range should be 0-255).

I was basically told this was expected given the Covid infection, but that it still raised my chance of very severe complications like 100 times.

My doctor said we weren't going to try anything just yet, I'm getting a new blood test next Tuesday, 3 days after the first one to see if things are improving and if so we're gonna leave it alone. But if they stay the same or God forbid get worse, then we're gonna try some real deal medications like blood thinners and such.

So what I expected was gonna be a good visit to the doctor since, like I said, I feel fine, turned out to be literally heartbreaking, knowing I have inner inflammation, my blood is thickening and who knows what else.

Is all this normal? Has this been observed on others that you know of? How has it progressed? What can I expect? I'm crying.

I entered the building wearing a brand new FFP3 respirator (N99) which I had bought purely for this visit. A  staff member immediately asked me to remove my mask and replace it with one of theirs which was one of these (useless) blue surgical masks. I was somewhat stunned by this. Needless to say there was no way I was going to comply and I was quite prepared to go home if necessary. Eventually after some discussion a doctor was called and she said my mask was the best available and there was no problem. A second doctor then requested me to wear a blue surgical mask over mine. I did not object to this since I could see that his intention was to give the impression of uniformity.  All proceeded well until I eventually got to the vaccination station. There were four or five staff sitting as close together as it was possible to be. There was also a seat for me right next to them where I was requested to sit while they prepared the vaccine. I declined and said I would prefer to maintain a 2 metre distance except when the vaccine was being given.  The staff members didn't seem to understand why I was reluctant to sit near them! Thank goodness I had a decent mask on. I later complained to NHS Healthwatch and subsequently received a reply from the centre  supervisor saying ""I am very disappointed to hear of your experience. Only this morning I gave a briefing to all the staff regarding the importance of social distancing"". He also said he would look into this further. From what I have seen on TV, my experience is far from unique. What on earth is wrong with people when even the medics at the nerve centre can't comply with the most basic regulations."

Once I was out I checked my bpm rate and it had gone up to 130 beats per minute, it actually reached up 132 only to then come back to the 120 range. My usual rate was about 70 bpm, but since I've developed symptoms it began to stay in the 90 range, high but apparently still ""normal"".

My 78 year old mom tested covid positive nov 13, 20 days ago.  She had mild symptoms - body ache, cough but never had a fever or needed O2.

She is currently in a rehab facility, was originally in for an infection (before covid) but was well enough to come home, then caught covid.  Before covid she cold walk 35+ feet with her walker, did all of her exercises and could do her toiletries.

Now she has trouble walking more than a few feet and only gets out of bed every couple of days.

What's worrying me though is the ""brain fog"" thing.  Before covid she was lucid and mentally sharp - ready to come home.  Now she has ""blank spots"" where she can't remember anything during parts of covid.  She also is speaking slower (though that is improving) but has issues with memory and things like day/date.  

So my Questions:
- how long does this ""brain fog"" typically last?  Is it permanent?  Does anything help with this?

Any info on this greatly appreciated,
Rob"

Monday and Tuesday I felt more tired than usual, as after you exercise a lot but nothing more.

On Thursday and Wednesday I was also in contact with another person who also turned out to be positive by Thursday.

On Wednesday I got PCR tested and on Thursday was told I was negative.

Both Thursday and Friday I had throbbing headaches for several hours, the kind that makes it painful when you shake your head.

Since Friday night and until Sunday so far I've felt I've had a fever, although I don't have a temperature reading. I've also felt joint/muscle pain especially in lower back and legs.

Since Saturday I've also had pain when moving my eyes side to side, kind of like eye strain but I'm not sure it could be related to the fever.

My usual resting heartbeat should be around 60-70 bpm, but these last couple days I've seen it go up to the 90-100 bpm range and even once up to 110 bpm, only to later come back to 70-80 bpm.

I have not experienced other symptoms such as cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, chest pressure, loss of smell or taste, etc.

Sometimes I feel a slight itch in my throat that disappears when drinking water.

I'm thinking I might get tested tomorrow again. Do you think the passed time between contacts with covid positive people is enough to actually show up if I have it? Or should I consider this might not be covid and pursue another kind of medical attention?

If in fact covid, does this is seem like a ""mild"" case so far? I'm male, 31 with no diagnosed health conditions."

                            ","Hello all,  my Mom is 78 years old and caught Covid in late November at a senior rehab facility.  It took about 2-3 weeks for her to ""recover.""

Before Covid my mom could walk 35 feet in her walker and do all her exercises etc.  She was due to come home and then caught Covid.

In December she seemed to loose almost all her strength.  At the end of December she could stand for a few minutes and transition from bed to a chair.  She came home around new years day.

She came home because of insurance reasons, otherwise I would still have her with skilled nursing.

It was obvious when she came home that Covid had wiped out her strength.  Unfortunately about a week after coming home, she had a** stroke and UTI**.  She was in the hospital for about a week and then she came home again.  While visiting her in the hospital, I of course contacted Covid.  I had a nasty time of it, where the monoclonal antibodies really helped.  In the meantime, for the two weeks that I was really sick, I could only help my mom with a few things like food & meds.  Since coming home from the stroke she has been bedridden.

So here's my question - she is currently bedridden and I am wondering what kind of recovery is possible?  When do people typically get their strength back?

*I've heard of people taking months to recover*  I think the combination of **covid + stroke** has done a number on her, however she is alive (count blessings) and she is mostly still there mentally though a little slow.  I have tried doing exercises with her - bed exercises - and while she can do it, it totally wipes her out.

If you have been through anything like this, please let me know.  Any comments appreciated.

Thanks,
Rob

PS - I have her on protein smoothies to get her strength back.  She is currently taking these supps:
1. Multi vitamin
2. D3
3. Fish Oil
4. cranberry concentrate - for UTI
5. womens probiotic (she also has an antibiotic for UTI)
6. zinc

On NY Day took a turn for the worse and was rushed into A & E by ambulance as I had pain in stomach, back, high temp and was being sick, breathing was shallow.
Long story short, temp went over 41, needed oxygen and steroids. Luckily even though there was talk of ICU I didn't need and came out after 6 days - although I am still quite poorly.
Since then I have good and bad days like most, but yesterday my mood was terribly low, so much so I couldn't stop crying (which is unlike me), and felt really depressed. I look very pale and now have the rash and spots everywhere.
Ive read that Dexamethasone can cause bad mood swings, Mania , and numerous neurological problems - and think i am suffering  from these.

                            ","Seen as most people with symptoms don’t self-isolate and super-spreaders are going to carry on regardless without a care. Is there an alternative way in which Covid-19 can be stopped..? 

The biggest problem with isolating once you have the symptoms is that it’s too late; the virus has been passed on already in the several days previous when there were no symptoms. If only we knew from day 1 when people got infected rather than several days later. 

Maybe the answer is **separation** and not isolation? 
i.e. separate the people who won't keep their distance/wash their hands from those who will. The former group (the pro-covid group) are probably going to get it anyway. So let them get it in a controlled way and they can separate themselves from others before they catch it. This will stop super-spreaders.

What if shops, pubs, other small businesses and people were to identify themselves as ‘pro-covid’ or ‘anti-covid’. So people who have Covid or who don’t believe in taking precautions would be classed as ‘pro-covid’ and can shop, eat, drink at specific places (or times) as long as they wear an identifiable pro-covid marker like a lanyard so that ‘anti-covid’ people and vulnerable people who want to take precautions and wash their hands know who they are and can keep their distance. The problem is not everyone believes in exercising caution or distancing and you can’t force them to. These people will probably catch it anyway so let them catch it, but rather than allowing them to be a super-spreader and passing it on unknowingly to vulnerable people in public, let them 'shop and spread' in a controlled environment. Whether that be in designated areas or specific times of the day. So people who want to be safe will be safer and people who believe in freedom and want to take their chances can do so. 

A good example would be to use students who can isolate in halls with like-minded people - because a certain percentage of them are going to mix anyway so identify the ones who are going to mingle anyway and let them socialise in their pro-covid bubble where they can catch it at the same time. This will give them and others they come into contact with in the future greater protection from greater immunity. A certain percentage may catch it again, but what percentage is this? Less than 5%? Surely that’s a good trade off. It will also allow others who are vulnerable or who fully intend to stick to the rules can fully separate themselves from the other spreaders. This is the only way to limit the spread! And it needn’t be for a long time, just a 2 week trial. At the very least it should be piloted in one area. Such as a university, where they are not interacting with others who do not have covid. 

Even if just 1 young healthy person in a thousand were to become seriously ill from getting covid after such an experiment - they would have prevented the spread from infecting a further 3 to 4 thousand people! (because the ‘R’ value in people who don’t believe in social distancing is probably over 3 or 4 compared to 0.5 or less in the ones who do.

I've had a look for this information on the gov site and the nhs site and all they tell you is about test and trace informing you and then you would need to self isolate etc. The other site says ""if you think you have been in contact with someone who has the virus then self isolate"". what I'm struggling with is that she doesn't think she has, she knows she has. And I don't think the virus cares whether or not these two people are in the same bubble.
Any sound help would be massively appreciated.

I've been working at a customers house that they have been renovating for the past couple of months. they moved out and went to live with one of their parents. I went there Tuesday night just to finish off some bits ( probably shouldn't of but they're about to have another baby and I wanted to complete before they moved back in) and one of them where in the home while I finished up. we passed a few times and had a chat probably no more than 5-10mins. I was there within the home for around 2hrs.

so the next day I receive a text off the customers saying that their dad who they have been living with for the last couple of months had been tested positive for covid that morning. The person who i had been in contact with is showing no symptoms but he has obviously been living with his dad long enough to surely pick up the virus. 

I really don't know what to do. would I have been exposed for long enough to contract covid. or was he not contagious because he was showing no symptoms. Should I try and get a test some how?

if anyone has had this or has some information on anything close I would much appreciate it.
many thanks."

For the fifth month now, the sense of smell and taste has not fully recovered (oranges, cucumbers, my adored watermelon have become disgustingly sickening in smell and taste for me.
The smells familiar to me have become completely different, having nothing to do with reality. I can't imagine my life without coffee, but coffee is now not at all the favorite drink that was before the illness. To be honest, it is very difficult for me to convey in words what I am experiencing, many do not understand how it is. Now a lot has changed for me, I start to forget the usual smells and tastes. When measured as a percentage, I can smell only 5 to 10% of smells and tastes. Sometimes I feel phantom smells, I used to wake up in the middle of the night from the smell of pomegranates, tangerines. I can say one thing, but the taste and smell have returned, but completely different and not very pleasant.

My church only has masses at 33% capacity and they are good about sanitizing the church after every mass. We maintain social distance (only every other pew is occupied with people well spread out and ushers will seat you) and wear masks, and all that. This morning I was seated 2 pews behind a family with 3 girls, looked like between ages of 8 and 14/15. They were all wearing masks but the middle girl (about 12 or 13?) was wearing it with her nose exposed the whole time. She was the only one not wearing it properly and neither of her parents seemed to care. She kept turning to her mother every minute or so and went to speak to her a couple of times, actually pulling the mask away from her mouth briefly as she did so. I couldn't believe it. I wanted to alert the ushers but they seemed oblivious and were too far away for me to get their attention.

Granted I have no idea if this girl is carrying covid. She didn't seem to look ill (she let out a tiny cough at one point but that was it) but the thing that worries me the most is asymptomatic spread and that you just don't know. She might even not know if she's carrying it (if she actually was). I was a fair distance away, not directly behind her (I'd say they were at least 10 feet in front of me and she was seated diagonally to my left). I was wearing an N95 mask that fit properly but I keep hearing how even they aren't enough to protect you.

I've got enough anxiety at the moment due to PMS (plus I'm a germophobe) so this is making it worse. Is there an extremely good chance I could have been exposed and infected? I'm very worried and thinking I can only rest easy until around the 17th or so if I haven't shown symptoms by then. I'm proactive, taking 1000mg of vitamin C a day as well as vitamin D, Zinc and Quercetin but I hope it's enough in case I was exposed. I'm even more worried because I heard about two guys around my age who recently died from it."

Having advised my employer of this ive been asked to provide them with confirmation of her test result?  Is that normal?  She isnt a minor, she is 22 years old.

I actually dont have a problem with it necessarily, BUT do they have the right to ask for the medical results from someone who isnt employed by them?  More to the point, what if my daughter doesnt want to disclose her results to a company she has nothing to do with.

Have they built up antibodies at all? Could they become re-infected this soon and be able to pass it on to us?

Went to the doctor last Monday for a week of low grade fever, horrible burning eyes, headaches and pressure between my eyes, sneezing and just didn't feel good.  He gave me antibiotics as suspected a sinus infection but I am not so sure!  I am on day 5 (Amox/Clav) and the fever is not breaking nor the headaches and burning eyes.   He didn't push being tested for COVID but now thinking I may have to do that.

Let me also ad I have NOT lost my taste or smell.  No cough or respiratory issues to speak of.  

I know everyone deals with COVID different but have ANY of you had issues with a low grade fever that just goes up and down like a rollercoaster, burning eyes and headaches at times?

I had all my blood work done and the only thing off was my cholesterol  (total 277 but my LDL was 177), blood sugar was 100 but I didn't really fast either AND my vitamin B-12 was 1400 (elevated) so I knocked off on the daily supplements that I thought would give me some energy!

Everything else (labs) are perfect and I don't feel icky accept in my head with this dang fever!

I would so appreciate to here if anybody else has experience this as I don't know what it would be and getting scared!  It's all I think about and it's Christmas.  Even with a crappy year I want to enjoy it and can't :("

I have received a letter from authorities telling me I will have to have an 'mRNA vaccine'.

I am a 65 year old male in generally good health and live in the UK.

I'm in the 5th Category (according to UK organisers) to get the vaccine.  They only have the Pfizer one just now with 'emergency approval' and are currently vaccinating people with it.  I fear by the time they get round to me  - say, February / March - that I may well get the AstraZeneca/Oxford one.  I know I will need a mRNA shot to fulfil the authorities' request.  (I assume this is because of the questions raised by the AstraZeneca trials - which is certainly fair - most definitely for someone my age because only 12% of people my age were involved in their trial - only 4% over 70.  I'm praying they just may make it - i.e., the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine - for under 55's. )

In any case I will need to get an mNRA vaccine - with which I'm fine with.  My question - which I can't seem to get anyone to answer - at least so far -  is this:

If I was to get the initial AstraZeneca (Vector) vaccine ... could I still have an mRNA one (say either Pfizer or Moderna)???  Would it be safe to do so?  Or are you restricted to one kind of format once you've had it originally???  Any one know how long should be between the two shots?  I'm thinking about three months - as that is the minimum length that theyseem to think those who have endured Covid have substantial antibodies following - or so I've read.

Any advice you can offer me in terms of this will be HUGELY appreciated.  I have been pondering this for days.

                            ","Hello,

i thought id outline my experience with the virus to both vent my own frustrations and to get to know if others have been the same.

I tested positive for CoronaVirus back at the start of October, prior to this i wasn't the healthiest person with a weight of 18.5 stone and no physical work outs, most sat between a computer and bed. I started with a fever which lasted 2 days and a small cough, i took and test and found out i had covid. The fever didnt get worse, but i did start to feel faint, and often began to have a few panic attacks when i felt i couldnt catch my breath, but i kept myself isolated away from my family. I then lost my sense of taste and smell after 3 days. All in all during having covid i was okay, other than the odd need to lie down and take some deep breaths on occasion i was doing my normal routine. 14 days later all of my symptoms where gone and i ordered a new test, this came back negative.

O how i wish to be back in those days as from here it only gets worse.

For the next few weeks i suffered with tiredness, shortness of breath awful chest pain, and an uncomfortable throat, not sore just not right. i used paracetamol daily, and was advice by my GP to use anti inflammatory over the counter medicine for my throat if i felt it was swollen. I used Ice packs and hot water bottles on my chest which really seemed to calm me down and easy the pain. By this point we are on week 4 and my shortness of breath just seems to be getting worse, i speak to my GP as ive been having stomach problems, constipation for a few days at a time with barely any bowl movement. I was prescribed a brown inhaler and advised on some over the counter laxatives to try to help. The brown inhaler does the trick for a little while and i feel i can take deep breaths again, the laxitive seems to give me some relief, but only a bowl movement every 2 days and its often diharea. I keep on like this for a week or so before i start to feel short on breath again, my aunty allows me to use her unopened spare blue inhaler and my GP lets me go for blood tests, they also then prescribe me a blue inhaler. The blood tests show high levels of dead red blood cells in my liver function, that they arnt too concerned about, and i am sent on my way for blood tests in 2 weeks time. About a week later my chest started to sound like their was fluid in there and i had an abnormal heart beat occuring so i went to A+E, they did blood work, a scan of the chest, blood preasure and oxygen levels and told me they can seem to find anything at risk and that im 'fit and healthy to go'. 

That was week 8 and all of last week i felt so bad, chest aches, pains in my arm pits when i lay or move certain ways, breathless, and a weight on my chest. I phoned my GP on thursday to discuss getting a new brown inhaler as mine seemed yo not work as it used to, after discussing how i was feeling she gave me a 5 day course of steroid tablets and a x-ray to be done at my local hostpital between 9:30 nd 4:30 any week day. I take my first round of tablets and my chest feels so relieved, but the strange slow covered heart beat is still there and keeps me on edge, i have my x-ray and come home to a call from my GP about my second blood tests and the ones from A+E, they say my liver function tests are still a bit abnormal and that i have a high count of redblood cells, to which they can wait 3 momths and see of its covid after effects or organise an untralsound, i opt for the later and await the hospital to mail. I explain my heart/lung feeling to the GP and he prescribes me  a 5 day course of antibiotics to take with my 5 day steroid tablets.

Day 1 felt good, things seemed okay, day 2 was a bit achey but once again okay and towards the night i felt like a new man. Day 3 was worse, tight chest most of the day, aches and pains, shortness of breath, and my neck just started to feel so stiff and clogged. Im on day 4 today and once again my chest is so heavy, my breathing feels shallow but i can take deep breaths on occassion, and i have 1 day left to pray i feel better before the course is complete. I still but far less frequently feel the odd heart beat and lung feeling, but my chest feels like a pair of hands is pushing on the top of my pecks no matter how i try to sit or lay.

All in all thats my story so far, week 9 begins today, im constantly scared to sleep and not wake up, or to wake up and be in more pain or have more issues. I just want to have 1 day of normal. I cant even do the things i used to enjoy like sit at a computer and talk with friends or play games, because i just feel so closed in and tight and on edge, last night i had a mild panic attack from just sitting there for 2 hours feeling breathless.

is there anyone that can relate or feels the same?

My medical background is no allergies, i had asthma as a child when i was 7 or 8 but im now 28, 29 in december, and i am above typical bmi.

Since my mom doesn't wear a mask at work, is it unsafe to be around her even if we all wear masks (including her) and wash our hands?

I've had initial headache 10 days ago. Last Saturday has low grade fever until Tuesday. Never had cough and since Tuesday no fever. Yesterday did some tests and :
- white cells and lymphocytes normal 
- elevated crp, 21
- elevated d dimer, 1550
- elevated fibrinogen, 730

X Ray of chest showed no problems with alveola, just some ""emphasis"" in tracea and bronchi. 

My doctor panicked and prescribed:
- two IV antibiotics 
- Heparin 
- dexamethasone IV

Talked to another doctor and he said it's bull. Maybe heparin, but it's not really neccesary. 
A third one said xarelto is enough and 4mg dexamethasone.

i don't know where to post this as google doesn't find any coronavirus forums, because news etc. take priority. I tried face mask, that blue type, which medical personal wears. There is huge space between nose and my face like 3cm+. I also found one, which has nano fiber - developed my local university. And it was almost too small and again: there is gigantic space between nose and face. It makes sense, because strings behind your ear on which holds face mask on your face, pull it outwards from your face, because nose.

I had respirator, which had this solved, but it teared: while i  gently stretched it... It was some russian crap, i didn't buy it tbh... But what concerns respirators... you can't breath in that, that's the problem. So i really need some good face mask. Problem is on many of these sites, they don't even list size. And even if they had like l, or xl. Common it is laughable, all people have different faces. Chances that they will fit are miniscule. Also majority is overpriced for one use, it would ruin me: trying to find a fit and than buy it frequently afterwards. And i am not even poor, or anything... IF there is even face mask, which doesn't have space between your nose. But coronavirus, is like microscopic particle, or smaller. 3cm is joke, i am not expert, but isn't it completely useless?  

It is really strange, that is 2020 and people can't even make face mask, which would be wearable... I am questioning my reality now..."

But when he started getting dizzy , we took him to the hospital. Doc said said he had low oxygen and high sugar levels. He got tested positive for covid and was kept in the hospital for a week  where he  got better, then we had to take him home because he made a huge fuss since he hates hospitals and feels very uncomfortable staying there. Doc said his oxygen level drops without an oxygen mask, so after much effort , we got him an oxygen concentrator. 1 week later, he has no fever and probably no other symptoms except for shortness of breath and low oxygen level. At first, he could stay 1 hour+ until his oxygen level drops to 80s, but now he's always on the concentrator. He doesn't say it, but i can tell he doesn't sleep much at night and sometimes his voice is hoarse during the day, his respiratory rate is around 24-27 bpm, and i don't know how long it will take for him to heal (if it will). He's taking enoxaparin 40mg and we're always checking his pulse ( usually jumps between high 80s and 90-95 with concentrator) and his sugar levels. Is there any estimates to how long this shortness of breath and dropping oxygen level can last for? few weeks? specially since we could only rent an oxygen concentrator and don't think we can keep it for long. Is there anything else i can do??

So I check on the internet and I see sore throat being one of covid-19 symptoms. I have mild sore throat that developed a week ago. It doesn't feel like a usual sore throat and it doesn't get worse when I swallow or anything. I went for a walk around 13 days ago and had a takeaway food a week ago. 

I have no other symptoms but the fact that I sometimes cough on purpose to try to relieve the itchy, scratchy throat. and my cough seems wet. Nothing seems to be relieving the soreness either which isn't that bad but it is bothering.

Should I be worried?

Edit: I have been having more acid reflux in the past 2 weeks as well. I did want to blame it on that but I took omeprazole and the reflux went away and sore throat remained."

My concern is the roll, in which the smartphone Bluetooth is applied.
I understand that if you become within 2mts  of a registered positive
tested person , who has put there information into the NHS app it will
then pair up with another phone which in turn will tell that person that they
have been in contact with a positive tested person. Problem I see is that
people may have to self isolate, on the phones information. There may
be no proof that these two phone owners have actually had physical or
biological contact. There might be an eight foot high garden fence between
them.  The average range on a Bluetooth device is 10mts so what's to prevent
that the Bluetooth pairing is done at 6mts

I am 22 (F), right now I am living at home with my mom and dad, and brother. My mom and I have been very good about not leaving the house unless needed, I have only been to work and occasionally out to a store for school supplies and I have had no issues. 

My brother on the other hand, has been out partying and drinking and around so many people this summer, long story short, he got covid around 3 weeks ago. Fast forward a bit and he is released from isolation, but now my mom tested positive for covid, and the only explanation is from my brother, since she wasnt around anyone else. 

Fast forward to now, and I am not feeling great. I do not have a fever but I started to get a small cough, I slept all day yesterday, and I have chills every once in a while. 

Does this sound like I could possibly have covid? My brother was asymptomatic minus he couldnt taste or smell, and my mom is doing much better but she felt like she had a bad sinus infection/cold. I really dont want to have covid, but I havent been anywhere in the past 2 weeks (work told me to stay home and quarantine) so I dont know, covid doesnt seem out of the question...

Fortunately he was diagnosed and treated very quickly, and has completely recovered.  I read that if someone has had Guillain Barré, they have about a 1% chance of getting it again in their lifetime.

My worry now is concerning Covid-19, particularly now that people seem to be ignoring the social distancing rules.  Is is possible or likely that a Covid-19 infection could re-trigger his Guillain-Barré?  He is in his 20's, and has just finished university, so he should be looking to start his career.  But should he be shielding instead?

I checked with staff if this was OK as didn't want to just join in case that wasn't aloud. But she was happy about it.  The table I was sat at my friend's was smaller but we were all sitting back in our chairs so it didn't mean we were all hunched over the table. We then moved on to a another pub but there was a bit of a wait to get in. Hardly any social distancing in place nobody listening to security at all. I then decided to leave as I wasn't comfortable in that situation. In hindsight I shouldn't of gone out. But now I'm scared I've put my whole family at risk. Or it's all in my head.

Today after 4 days having sort of mild cramps here and there around chest area . No fever but I need to sometimes clear up my throat. 

I am worried if I was exposed to Covid or these symptoms are because of covid


Though I followed all good habits I suddenly had difficultly breathing. Today  I was not able to breath through nose as those turbunates were kind of blocked. 

I suspect it triggered my anxiety and I had episode of shortness of breath. I used Arbuterol ashtama spray and felt better.  I also regularly use antihistamines and steroid nasal spray. Not sure if its contributing to dry nose...


One more thing when I did take steam I realized magically that swelling reduced to certain extent and I am able to breath normally but chest or ribs are still paining little bit

                            ","Hi All,

I don't know what I expect from posting on here, I guess I just want to know that I'm not alone and it would be good to share our stories with each other. 
My husband (39) was struck down with it at the end of March. I (37) got it exactly a week later, early April. A couple of weeks later both my boys (2 & 4) suffered with mild symptoms. April was a hard month. 
We fought off the virus at home, we were never tested as they weren't testing unless you were seriously in need of hospital care. So there is the worry that we didn't have Covid, however we had almost all the symptoms at some point in April and we are living with the havoc is causes to your body and mind still today.

I have achey days where I can barely move. I still suffer with chest pains. Sharp in the front and the feeling that somebody is sat on my back. Early June I attempted some light exercise and was left with a crackly breath and horrendous chest pains. I went to A&E and luckily it wasn't lung clots, however its muscle damage/scarring in my lungs. I was informed like its no big deal and I should just rest for 3-6 months. This is a big deal to an active person like myself who relies heavily on exercise to help my mental health too!
I suffer with headaches that put me in bed for a few hours due to the dizziness/nausea they cause. 
I also don't have a great digestive system anymore. 

My Husband has the dizziness/nausea/headache symptoms come back every fortnight that put him in bed for a day or two. This has also caused issues with his digestive system. 

My little 2 year old has had a recurring cough for weeks and weeks. I worry. I try not to but this is so concerning. The doctors aren't concerned because he is well in himself and there are no signs of an infection. This is sad that its now deemed ok for him to suffer with a bad cough for so long. 

What I'm starting to get annoyed over is the media's focus being solely on the survival rate. We are survivors yet our health is severely affected. People are going about their lives thinking this won't affect them because they're young and healthy and it will. There are even articles written on asymptomatic people who show lung issues.

I am so angry this has happened to us and scared about what this means for my children's health in the future. As somebody who already was affected by anxiety on a daily basis I am concerned over my growing obsession with this and what it is also doing to my mental health. 

We are taking Vitamin D and eating healthy, as we were before Covid. We are no longer exercising as much. I don't know what else I can do to help my family going forward. 

Thank you for listening. "

Even tho I wear a mask 24/7 and try to keep a distance from crowds as much as possible, these 2-3 days I started getting some extreme fatigue cases where at some moments of the day I feel so fatigued that I couldn't even move to the kitchen for example. Before the Corona out-brake I used to walk for a lot of kilometres a day, now after months in isolation I feel like I cant go to  the supermarket and not get tired.

(I would like to point out that Im a smoker)

I don't have a high Temperature,nor Coughing nor Sore Throat but I have this feeling of being able to breath a lot Easier (?) than I could before, and that seems strange to me because this has never occured to me before.

I also have sudden wakes up early in early hours such as 5AM and such (Just the time that im writing this forum discussion) .  

Could I be an A-Symptomatical case?  Or its just Spring fever that occurs regularly..


All best,

-Kristijan

I identifies so much with so many of your testimonies, that I took that to mean that I too was experiencing a freak prolonged covid episode. Like most of you, I was very sick. Throughout I was terrified, not only of my own sickness, but of my friends and family, and the that of the crumbling world around me. I researched and read every article out there on symptoms, pandemic management, contagion etc. I also read up way too many healthcare pages and self diagnosed all sorts of whacky symptoms and side effects. I tried asthma and allergy medication,  I tried steroids, abx, the works... I had cat scans, x rays and blood tests, Mr saw at least 3 doctors. Nothing was wrong with me. No with my body at least...
I had a flu, maybe even covid, but that didn't  last longer than a couple of weeks. my cough and tiredness must have lingered a bit, but the disease was gone. What happened to me, and I'm sure to most of you out there, is that at some point in our worries we transitioned from a physical illness to an anxiety disorder, and this requires a diametrically opposed treatment to what we're doing. I could not believe anxiety could cause such physical symptoms, but believe me when I say it can. Myalgia, burning sensation, chest tightness, GI symptoms... I suffered from all of these things excruciatingly. 

Please, if you're out there and feel like you've had covid symptoms for more than a month, it's time to put down you computer, phone and tablet, rest, relax, meditate, see a mental health professional, and finally embark on the road to recovery. I'm on my way there after over 2 months.

In the kitchen, we have a fridge, several counters, many drawers, a hutch with snacks, a pantry and storage area with snacks, two sinks, etc. There are over 200 touch surfaces, so I just thought that by only allowing the two adults get food for everyone, we would potentially be minimizing the spread of germs from one house to another.

                            ","Hello all,

Apologies for starting a separate thread on this. I am really suffering from very annoying insomnia due to Covid (suspected) and was wondering if anyone is keen to share their experience? It seems a lot of us are having problems sleeping. 

Week 2-3: Terrible. Some nights of complete no sleep.
Week 4-12: Fragmented 5-7 hours. Waking up every hour or two. There were only a handful of nights that I could get 3-4 hours in a row. Sometimes I wake up and find myself over-breathing.
Week 13-14: Gone backwards again. 3-4 hours on average per night.

The problem is staying asleep, rather than falling asleep. I'm using melotanin, also valeriaan and CBD. None seems to really keep me asleep.

How has your experience been? Anything that helped?

The theory is that this is to do with your vagus nerve. In the process of fighting off the virus it is a bit messed up and may take a long time to heal and reset itself.

Many thanks"

I'm now into my 11th week of illness. I've never had a test for covid but am still struggling with breathlessness. I spoke to my doctor again today and this is what he told me, I'm sure many of you will find this reassuring.
I was beginning to worry that it wasn't covid and if not what the hell was it, but he said he speaks to patients every day with the same symptoms as many of us on here who have been also suffering for many weeks and some of these have had positive tests for  covid and is very certain that's what I've had.
He also said the reason I'm struggling is to do with the alveoli in the lungs. He said they are not getting the oxygen to the body properly which is why your chest sounds clear but you can't breathe. He was very insistent about this. 
This article helps explain it:
https://health.clevelandclinic.org/heres-the-damage-coronavirus-covid-19-can-do-to-your-lungs/
He also said the antibody tests are not great and to just take it that it is covid I've had. He said to carry on with what I've been doing ; walking gently when I can. He also said other patients symptoms are also up and down just like mine and proof of my o2 stats fluctuating is proof it's my alveoli not working properly (I have a fitness tracker which also measures o2).
I hope this helps to put your mind at rest like it did with me and make you realise we are not going mad or dying of something else! He said it is going to take time to improve. "

literally a week later I was in bed with severe fever tastebuds completely gone because I live on the Isle of Wight I sent off for a test which came back negative. I found my GP querying my fever to be told by GP that 30% all the tests from his patients had come back negative and had to be run redone again. I sent off another test which came back void. following week I felt really well full of energy went walking along the cliffs tastebuds came back sadly four days later the fever started up again on different parts of my body really bad burning sensation on my feet around my shoulder blades cross my stomach and has caused upset.
I was really surprised that the fever had come back so I sent off another test which came back negative again I phoned my GP to say that I had concerns if this wasn’t COVID-19 there must be something wrong with me my kind GP for me they were for such things as fevers before COVID-19 and to continue taking paracetamol every day I’m 65 and it’s my birthday next Wednesday I do have heart disease and I am slightly overweight and suffer from asthma apart from the fever I’ve had muscle pain on my legs mainly around the shins and headaches. very difficult to gauge COVID-19 as the doctors don’t know much about it nor do I it is strange how some days I feel quite well and then the fever just kicks in and I have to go to bed I’m surprised  I hear that some people are given antibiotics my GP has categorically said this is a virus antibiotics will not work thankfully the paracetamol are keeping things at bay I haven’t got a thermometer so I I don’t know what my temperature is quite often I have to have a water bottle and now I feel I meant on fire inside my body I’m quite cool on the outside.

When my symptoms starting so did a strange Rash all over my stomach and a strange silent rumble which I couldn't tell if it was coming from the top of my stomach or my chest? I had diarrhoea in the 2nd week and the rumble disappeared for a week but has since come back.  The rash has spread under my arms, groin area and lower back.  Doctor said this probably was not Covid related but since it's been there since my symtoms started I beg to differ!! it's been there 8 weeks now!! has anyone else had similar symtoms for this long?

They are spritely 91 year olds, a little slow on their legs but otherwise healthy and not on any medication.  I am retired, as is my wife.  My brother works in the waste disposal industry and his wife cleans at a (currently COVID free) smaller nursing home.  Both my brother and his wife have regular tests for the virus, all having showed up as negative so far.  They get the results 3 days after attending the test.

The other weekend myself and my wife called around to see my parents unannounced and witnessed my brother and his wife inside, albeit at least 2 metres away, drinking tea/coffee prepared with my parents' crockery.  No PPE worn either.  My brother has the opposite attitude to risk avoidance to me and sees my stance as a overreaction.  He seems to have convinced our parents also of this.  They (correctly) see his wife as undertaking a heroic and crucial task in maintaining the cleanliness of the home in which she works, but then say they do no not want to banish her.

When I call around to do their cleaning, they always retire temporarily to their garden summer house and read / do crosswords etc.

When I call with my wife, we either stay in their garden or talk at the door.  My mum especially fusses and says ""come in and have a cup of tea"" - which we politely decline.  My parents have now been isolated in their suburban home for 10 weeks and have not ventured out.  

Am I right in my reaction? Am I justified in saying my brother and his wife should stay outside the home when they call?  "

I've sent the post shown below to several people as replies to their posts.   I hope I'm not over posting which I know can be irritating but I've had such success with the treatment method described below that I'm on a real campaign to encourage Corona patients to try it.   Feedback would be great.  Anything from ""nope, didn't work for me to yes I'm healed"" would be appreciated.Pray we can beat this thing. 

I had flu symptoms coming on strong on March 25, 2020.  Not sure if it was Corona or just regular flu.   Anyway I immediately used a method I call my ""kill flu"" treatment which I've been using with 100% success for the past 20 years.   Just suggesting that you try it because it's been so successful for me.  Hoping it could be successful for you.   Very simple: A. Drink 3 glasses of very warm water (not hot enough to burn you but definitely very warm). B.  Use a hair blower on medium temperature to blow warm air onto your face for 30 minutes.   C.  Use deep breathing for the 30 minutes to repeatedly fill your lungs with warm air.  Also breathe in through your nose for awhile then through your mouth etc. trade back and forth.  D.  Do this 2 to three times a day for a couple of days.Hope this works for you.  

It literally changed my life  20 years ago.   I'm a retired teacher and when I first started teaching I would get quite sick multiple times with the flu each year from October to March.  Called in sick constantly during that time period each year.   Finally out of desperation and much research I came up with the method described above.  I had reached the point where I was considering quitting teaching.   First time I used this method I was back to normal in one day.   From that point on I never called in sick again due to the flu.   I've been reading so many stories of people suffering through Corona; it just tears at me. I’m  making this suggestion to as many as possible.   It definitely  worked for me on the flu (and possibly on Corona in March).   I really hope this method works for Corona patients.   Sincerely, Rowland Reeves"

A couple of days later and my chest started to feel raw and sore just assumed i had a virus ....probably covid.  My  chest started to burn constantly all day long the burning lasted 3.5 weeks. Then sharp pains felt like it was flipping from one side of my chest to the other, also felt like the burning went down to my tummy area. Shortness of breath begun day 7. Sometimes it was so bad I had to really concentrate on my breathing to catch my breath. Also my heart rate has been through the roof as soon as I move, walk a little it goes really high like I’m fast walking/jogging etc  145bpm feel dizzy. Week 2 started with the hot night sweats! Waking up like I’m on fire. Sweating awful Body odour-I don’t suffer with this normally.  Still having the hot sweats week 7... every night. Also had facial flushing and have had a temp on and off for 6 weeks. headaches and body aches  I was given antibiotics after 3 weeks Incase. I went to the hospital as the doctors said it couldn’t be covid as it was going on too long. I had a chest X-ray that was clear. Sent home. I wondered if the virus has caused some sort of gastric issues and that the burning is due to severe acid reflux. Something I’ve NEVER suffered from only when pregnant. I’m now on Omeprazole 40g for 2 weeks. The burning and pain in my back has eased. I’m now left with the some chest pains but the high heart rate upon walking around my house has not gone away nor has the acute breathlessness. Has anyone had high heart rate, severe gastric issues eg oesophagitus and shortness of breath , hot sweats with this illness?

I believe I had Covid at the end of March, (symptoms were tight chest, breathing laboured, temperature and chills, fatigue, and a sore throat, which lasted initially for ten days, and then a week after feeling I was.recovered, I had a resurgence of my symptoms. 
Since then, I've noticed that I've started getting symtoms of a very runny nose and eyes streaming when I drink alcohol. i don't think it can be hay fever as I don't have those symptoms any other time.  At first I thought it was an intolerance I might have to cider, but having drank a glass of wine list night, and had the same problem.. I'm now thinking it might be all alcohol. This definitely wasn't happening before Covid.
I am having feelings of nausea most days, which I wonder if means the virus might still be lingering after reading others posts, although I did have a test a couple of weeks ago, and that was negative.
i would be interested to hear people's thoughts, and if they've noticed something similar?

Thanks

Yesterday morning both me and my partner woke up feeling very hot - we believe this is because we had a winter duvet on the bed and have no air flow or windows in the bedroom, and with the warmer weather, we think  we must have overheated a little. When I got up to go to the toilet, I felt really hot and a little light-headed, achy. I didn't want to touch my usual morning tea  as I felt queasy as well. I attempted to eat lunch, but only felt more nauseous after a couple bites. My boyfriend, although he felt hot and a little nauseous upon waking up, felt fine after an hour or two, and still is.

Early in the afternoon, I threw up. I felt better and relieved of my nausea for a little while until I started to feel achy, nauseous and feverish again. I was sick again shortly after. I had a couple of naps in the afternoon which made me feel better. By the end of the day I felt significantly better, only a little achy and a little hot. I never measured my temperature as I don't currently have a thermometer, but it felt that any potential fever was dwindling as I was no longer fidgeting or feeling any slight chills.

I slept well, only woke up with a slight headache and much lesser body aches, which have mostly gone as of now.  I no longer feel feverish or hot to touch, and have been able to eat and drink (just unable to do my usual quantities). I look a lot better today too. I would just like to say that I am not pregnant (haven't had sex since my last period), and I have had zero contact with the outside world since lockdown has begun. I am isolating with my boyfriend and his family at their home in a rural area. I only go out for walks. His parents have been doing the shopping as we are working from home full-time. They have been very careful in doing so and follow all the precautions.  I was going to consider being tested today if I still felt feverish, but I don't. Nobody believes I have it, but I am a hypochondriac so it still worries me. I have no other symptoms and feel far better today. Should I be concerned that this is covid? "

And then Friday I have another yearly physical at my pulmonologist's office (was diagnosed with mild asthma when I was 12, though starting to wonder if I outgrew it as I no longer take daily medication for it and my symptoms have pretty much disappeared).

I'd read some good info not long ago that it's the viral load that does you in with this virus.. that going to the supermarket for a short time or being outside doesn't normally expose to you a great amount of the virus, but if you're in an indoor, enclosed setting for a greater period of time especially  with a large group of people, you could get exposed to a huge dose of it. I know hospitals carry the threat of a great amount of exposure (my uncle is currently hospitalized for non-covid-related kidney failure and they forbid us to visit him), and I'm wondering if it's that bad for doctors' offices and medical labs.

I did call the lab last week for info on precautions they're taking. They're having patients call them from their car in the parking lot and letting them know when to come up to the lab. They're also requiring them to wear masks (but not gloves, for some reason). That makes me feel a little better, but the radiology group where I'm having the mammogram done hadn't said anything when I called last month to reschedule (appt was originally on the 18th of April).  I'm also wondering if I should reschedule my pulmonologist appt. Like I said this is just a yearly follow-up, it's not an urgent appt.

I'm just very uncomfortable about being in this type of setting three days in a row with the danger of being exposed again with this area still being a hot spot. One of the offices (primary care doctor I think) said their health care workers get tested daily, but I'm concerned about coming into contact with other patients who may be asymptomatic and could infect me. I'm 42 and no underlying chronic conditions (save for the very mild asthma which again I suspect I've outgrown) but I hear about people around my age who the media say are ""otherwise healthy"" becoming critically ill. I haven't left my house since the beginning of March when I'd seen my primary care doctor for an upper respiratory infection. I've gone outside walking my dogs in the neighborhood and exercising in my back yard, but I haven't gone shopping or anything like that...other family members have done so over the past 2 months and thankfully they haven't been sick. But again I'm concerned about the environment of the doctors' offices. Any advice? Should I cancel all the appts or maybe just keep 1?

Thought I'll start a separate thread for this. I had a fever 10 weeks ago. The fever lasted 3 days but after the fever went I just simply struggled to sleep.

These days my sleeping is very poor, managing 4-7 hours on average of interrupted sleep. This is even with the help of melatonin.

I'm still fatigued and suffering some mild cold like symptoms after 10 weeks. 

My trouble with sleeping is not helped by my anxiety. Doctor found I was extremely low on Vitamin D so now I'm taking supplements. The lack of Vitamin D may also have contributed to my sleeping problems and slow recovery.

Just wondering if anyone has the same sleeping problem with confirmed or suspected Covid-19? How are you coping?

What I mean is sleeping problems as a symptom of the virus or as an after-effect of the virus, not due to worry or anxiety.

Many thanks"

Since the start of the Covid-19, there have been many debates around the wearing of the mask, the use of hydro-alcoholic gels and other barrier gestures to put in place, but nothing about the door handles, which are vectors of invisible bacteria. Whether it is individuals, businesses or the medical sector, we should consider installing secure, sanitized and non-contact hand grips so that the hands do not come into direct contact with the handles.
Instead of using your hand as usual, you should be able to use your forearm, and even more precisely your elbow, by setting up the equivalent of a hand-free handle. This would avoid permanent disinfection of our door handles or opening with disposable towels, problematic for the environment...

                            ","Six weeks ago on March 24 I developed symptoms of Covid-19, namely raised temperature (but not fever), dry cough, upset stomach and intense fatigue. As there was no possibility of a test, I have no certainty but as a key worker out and about in the community I am pretty certain it was the Coronavirus.  

I still do not feel normal. I typically feel tired, although my daily walk and other physical activity do not seem to lead to real exhaustion.  I find that work-related Zoom Conferences often provoke an episode of stomach upset and nausea. I sometimes feel mildly 'fluey' , with a minimal but discernible sore throat. My muscles are twitching rather than aching (although this has been diminishing in recent days). I generally sleep through the night and my appetite is only a little diminished. But I'm not getting that morning burst of energy and am sleepy for much of the day. 

When the pandemic began, the advice was that people with mild symptoms were better after 14 days. So I wonder whether this is still the recovery period nearly two months on, whether it might be Post Viral Fatigue Syndrome or the beginning of something more long-term like CFS. Should I be trying to see my GP at this stage (if he will see me) or just keep going?

Had a fever 9 weeks ago which lasted 3 days, then 3 days or so of green/yellow phlegm and 4-5 weeks of white phlegm.

Throughout this whole time I've been fatigued and worst of all have significant trouble sleeping. When the sleep problem started around 8 weeks ago there were nights when I couldn't sleep at all.

Now I manage anywhere between 4-8 hours of sleep a night. The sleep is very interrupted and not very good quality. Often I would take up after 1-2 hours and struggle to fall back asleep.

I also seem to be suffering post viral fatigue. I can manage daily activities no problems even incorporating some exercise (bike rides etc....), but when I exert myself I sometimes get a slight sore throat and runny nose, typical post viral fatigue symptoms. It seems sleep disturbance is another post viral fatigue symptom.

I did a CRP test 2 weeks ago and the doctor confirmed that the infection is gone, and I'm just feeling the after effects.

Anyone else going the same thing or having trouble sleeping?

Many thanks"

Is this right ?  Could I still have had covid 19 ?  I honestly felt on deaths door and for a few days I have no memory and was in constant sleep.

Then the cough got worse and I developed a `low grade temperature of around 37 .5 (By the way - GP said not everyone gets the high temperatures) and felt tired and unwell and went on sick leave.  This developed into a  worse cough and shortness of breath and I was prescribed a course of Doxycycline antibiotics. Currently after 3 weeks off work I am feeling a lot better when sitting around doing not much or generally looking after myself, however if I exert myself a little ie taking my dog for a short walk - I am wheezing and short of breath. I feel bad for being off work as I know that my colleagues are stretched with sickness, but I am not sure if I am actually ready to go back and ready for an 8 hour shift at work???
