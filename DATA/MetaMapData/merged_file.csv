0,High risk and just tested positive,https://covid19.camhx.ca/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=123,2022-06-06T16:34:45-04:00,Survey Girl,"
I'm high risk for severe covid and I just tested positive. I've gone this entire time without catching it and now I got it. I contacted it from someone at work. I'm on day 3 and I seem to be feeling worse everyday. I'm just curious what helped you through the symptoms and beating it? I'm completely stressed about what's going to happen.

Any advice on a primary school teacher testing positive? The school seems to be telling teachers that they must attend work if tested positive.

2,How do we move on?,https://covid19.camhx.ca/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=121,2022-04-13T13:33:30-04:00,Respiratory Therapist,"
I am a respiratory therapist who worked the front line the past 2 years. It's been incredibly challenging for me to go back to normal life. I've watched 100+ people die and suffer throughout the pandemic, feeling helpless. It felt like nothing we did saved them. Watching people come into the hospital and knowing they're going to be dead within the day or the week and having to pretend like everything is fine. Or watching someone die suffering in their last moments. With my job I am at by their heads, watching their faces, watching them struggle to breathe and suffer, before dying completely alone with usually just myself and maybe a nurse in the room. It's hard to make the mental switch to now ""okay covid is over let's get back to normal"" after all I've witnessed.It makes me feel like all of the lives lost are invalidated. How am I supposed to move on from this? How do I go back to normal life without forgetting all the people who've lost their lives?Does anyone else struggle with this issue? I feel like I'm the only one who can't let go.

I was positive for Covid over a year ago and suffer from a long list of I guess they are called ailments? Sometimes I feel like I am the only one out there. Am I crazy? Am I really this weak? I feel depressed, useless. Anyone else feel like me? Countless dr bills dr visits only to hear oh we’re sorry we just don’t know enough about post Covid to treat you.

I’m a 38 year old man; and throughout my life have been in contact with chicken pox on a yearly basis, I’ve never contracted it or had it. Now it seems I’m having the same reaction to covid, I’ve been exposed to so much of it, through work and home, my  family go down with highly contagious omicron and I don’t get it. My 9 year old son is exactly the same with chicken pox and covid the same as me. Does anyone else relate to this as I would love to know?

5,Got COVID positive after fully vaccinated - loss of taste/smell,https://covid19.camhx.ca/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=113,2021-05-03T09:24:45-04:00,Tony Pony,"
Hi,I was fully vaccinated about 3 months ago (pfizer) and have now caught covid.  The tracing of this has led to a friend of a friend of friend who went to a gathering in Toronto and brought it home with him.  So, I think it is the B117 strand since I did get symptoms and tested positive.My initial symptoms were low grade fever, never higher than 37.6C/99.8F.  I had a runny nose for about 1 day and a bit tired the next day with sinus pressure.  On the third day I lost my smell and especially taste.Any information on when I will regain smell/taste?  Anyone else gone through this AFTER already being vaccinated?

Hi, I am doing everything I can to keep safe but keep feeling anxious about whether my family members will get it, or whether I will get it and whether we will get a serious case and have to go to the hospital or if it will get even worse and one of us will die of it. I feel helpless even though we are all doing whatever we can to keep safe.

8,Loneliness during COVID,https://covid19.camhx.ca/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=110,2021-03-23T16:19:39-04:00,Dale H,"
Being alone is hard enough sometimes, but keeping busy has helped me coupe to some extent. Even though I may do some video conferencing and talk to some of my friends and family on the phone, Facebook at times is a cesspool of garbage at times and some express wants and needs or how they are feeling. I don't think this is helpful, although some of my friends are at least living with others. I still get loneliness feelings. I feel like no one really cares...but I know this is not true but my brain is getting caught up with the non-in person visiting. I love being around people, not necessarily those who I know either.  How are others feeling in this situation? Any suggestions as to how to curb this and feel better?

9,Feeling Abused by Expectations on LTC Managers &amp; Staff,https://covid19.camhx.ca/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=109,2021-02-08T10:02:41-05:00,Mustang Sally,"
I am becoming more and more frustrated by the expectations the Ministry of LTC, Ministry of Labour and Resident families are putting on the LTC worker.  We have been getting swabbed for testing once a week since November.  Staff come in on days off for no compensation now they are introducing rapid testing which will be 3 x a week yeah.  Our nasal passages will look like someone that has been abusing coke for years.  No other sector is subjected to these invasive test routinely.  I was one of the lucky staff to receive my initial vaccine but now it is day 31 with no word when next dose will come.  I always was taught to follow the drug companies guidelines when taking medication so find this ambiguity very frustrating.

Hi!I have had a few episodes of depression which at the moment is controlled. However, I had a rough day at work yesterday and feel the beginnings of saddness which can lead to depression if I'm not careful. I can usually handle the odd bad day as we all get them and it's part of being human but I'm wondering if because of all the other things going on, the pandemic, lack of fun time, haven't seen friends lately, if it's pushed me over the edge a bit....I feel so so tired and just want to be by myself....but maybe that's because I've been working more lately and am around people quite intensely with my job...I""m not sure if it's the depression or just normal needing down time. I also had my first covid test yesterday on my way out of work, It was quick and not too bad but a few minutes after on my way to my car I was seconds from passing out! I've feel a bit off since...and I didn't make it into work today...I am self employed luckily so I can switch days if I really have to...I feel pretty embarassed about that, thank god I made it to my car so no one saw me!!One of my major tools to help deal with depression has not  been available to me since March, it's a support group and it's the one thing that I really do miss:(

13,Just Reaching Out,https://covid19.camhx.ca/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=106,2020-10-19T12:04:31-04:00,John Doe,"
Hello,     I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder three years ago. I have taken part in the Dialectic Behavioral Therapy offered at my local CMHA about a year and a half ago. Besides struggling with BDP, I tend to struggle with Social Anxiety as well as Depression. To say the least, the pandemic has been a little overwhelming at times. Couple that with getting a new job in May of this year and I have been very anxious most days. One of the more ironic things about my employment is that I am working at my local CMHA so unfortunately, due to conflict of interest concerns I am not able to be treated there. I was referred to a different agency close to where I live, but I was not able to keep my appointments and my counselling just kinda fell off after a while. Around the same time I was also seeing a behavioral change counsellor about my substance abuse issues, but that also kinda just fell off at the start of the pandemic due to the counsellor I was seeing taking time off for personal safety reasons and neither one of us really following-up on things. Somewhat needless to say, things have been rough at times, I know I'm not the only one going through stuff, all of humanity is basically dealing with the issues related to the pandemic, so I don't want to come off as I think I am the only one or anything like that, but with my condition and circumstances, things can be pretty difficult for me. Due to the previously mentioned things as well as the fact that I live alone and can feel quite lonely at times, I wanted to make this post. Just to reach out and tell my story, or at least a part of it, as well as let anyone out there with similar things that your not alone. I know how empty those words can seem when your going through things, but from someone who knows that type of pain and hurt, I just want to say your not alone. I promise.

Hello, I am new here. I have an Autistic 21 year old son who likes to go the Malls and Parks and I am seeking a good mask for him. My research is showing that N95 masks are the safest but they are not reusable or washable. The 2nd best are Surgical masks but these are disposable. So both options would be expensive.Can anyone recommend a reusable/washable mask which would suffice or would it be best to go with one of the above mentioned please? Thank you.

15,Friend problem,https://covid19.camhx.ca/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=93,2020-05-08T12:17:29-04:00,Catness 45,"
I have a friend who I recently reconnected with after a few years. Now she is into all of the COVID conspiracy theories and is very anti-government. She went to the COVID protest at Queen's Park, even though it was a 4 hour drive. I'm finding her ideas to not be helpful to my mental health. I don't know how to, in a healthy way, create some space between us, at least until this is over. Any suggestions? She wants to Skype and sends me articles. It's not like there's much else to talk about right now if we were to Skype; I don't think I could not talk about COVID. This friendship is creating quite a bit of stress for me. We used to be best friends so I don't want to exclude her from my life permanently.

18,Is anyone perfect when it comes to physical distancing?,https://covid19.camhx.ca/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=100,2020-06-02T15:52:05-04:00,Guitar Girl,"
Hello,While I know that we all need to practice physical distancing at all times, I'm having trouble doing it perfectly.  I live on a street which is tiny and cramped and has kids on it.  When I walk out my door, there are my neighbours 10 feet away on their own property.  I love all my neighbours.  I have a kid too and our kids play together--not all day but sometimes on weekends.  They ride bikes, play hockey or soccer on the street and are trying to stay 6 feet away from each other but it's not perfect.  The only way to do this perfectly would be to yank my kid inside the house each time someone else comes out.   I have taken my kid to the park etc. but there are always more kids at the park than on my street. Plus, kids at the park are all strangers, not like the bubble of 4 families of neighbours who all know each other.  They say it takes a village to raise a child and my little street is a village.  I find that taking my kid to the park comes with more risks than letting them play on the street where everyone is known to them.So, I'm not a perfect physical distancer but am doing my best.  But if there are other insights or advice that people have, I would like to hear it. Thanks.

I'm finding it difficult to figure out what kind of services are available and what aren't for people with addiction. I've seen online news reports from Hamilton saying many of their harm reduction services are closed and I'm wondering what's available in Toronto?

I can't find stuff on their website about changes in their programs other than the fact that things are moving online more. Anyone know where I can find this kind of information without having to call every program/org I come across?

I have been thinking about going back on medication, but I don't know where to start or how to ask my doctor as i am not fully comfortable with him. Any advice would be great about asking for help and getting back on medication. thanks

I am a seasoned expert in the above techniques and I would love to share my education, experience and knowledge. I am both a ""survivor"" of two major mental health crises and a trained health professional in meditation, mindfulness and stress reduction.As well as sharing my knowledge, I am always interested in learning new things! So let's keep the dialogue in this area alive ;-)Here are a few things you can do RIGHT NOW to help you relax:1, Backwards counting from 50 with your breath: Start at 50 INHALE; EXHALE at 49; INHALE at 48; EXHALE at 47 and so on. If you forget what number you were at or reach 0 and are still not relaxed - simply restart at 50. I use this to help me drift off into sleep quite often.2. TAKE 5: INHALE for 5 seconds (say the word 'steamboat' silently in your head for each full second if you don't have a watch) THEN - EXHALE for 5 seconds. Repeat 5xs through. When you get good at this you can try holding the breath for 5 seconds in between - BUT please be seated or laying down for this as holding the breath may cause dizziness.

I think during this pandemic my cravings have grown to increasingly unbearably painful to manage because I’m stuck in my house trapped in my own thoughts. Thinking about past traumas have been all that’s flowing through my mind and since getting clean I’ve been finding it harder to cope with the fact that im kind of losing my sense reality because I want to find a way out of feeling the way I do. But since losing my counsellor it’s been difficult reaching out to a someone new because of my abandonment issues and the feeling of being scared that if I talk to someone new that they’ll just leave me too. That thought stems from being in the foster system for my whole youth and losing a lot of people in my life whether it’s through death like my biological parents or losing a friend because they’ve grown tired of hearing the same thing from me with having constant problems and now having no one I’ve just felt alone.

Found out recently I'm at a higher risk of infection because of my medication. It's only every 6 months and the highest risk times are the days/weeks following a dose. Unfortunately my next dose is this week and my fear has gone through the roof.Having to commute to a clinic (thankfully not being done at the hospital) and sit through the administration of the medication which takes 5-6 hours and makes me feel exhausted and just crappy only to have to commute home, knowing my immune system was just partially obliterated and then waiting for a few weeks through the usual discomfort it causes hoping I didn't catch anything has had me completely wound up.Made worse by the fact that I need to go to downtown Toronto, to a hospital, to get a test done, a week after i get this medication given, I'll still be elevated risk and coping with the associated fear of the given circumstance is feeling overwhelming.

Given the current situation, globally, we certainly are not alone regarding a disconnect from what was the norm not very long ago. However, for me, I've taken the opportunity to ""Look"" deeply within without any judgment whatsoever and to also appreciate what is right, like the sun, the rain, a blue sky, the clouds, flowers starting to grow, listening to sounds of nature, going for walks, reading a book etc. For many people they may in fact find it difficult doing ""No-thing"" , however, doing nothing is its own meditation and in fact is ""Effortless"". Riding the wave of life embracing it with all of our senses can invoke a real sense of freedom from what might have been the ""Norm"". This can be a time for reframing how we think and feel and improving lifestyles, taking breaks from information overload, and being present to what really matters. This could be a time for Clarity in our lives about what we actually need versus the things we may want. One thing for sure, many feelings and emotions are similarly felt regardless of what part of the Globe you reside we can all relate to Love, Support, Compassion etc.

We, as most people, are trying to stay home as much as possible and have not had any visitors since all this began, nor have we gone to visit anyone.

Multiple people in a very small apartment. An apartment that the heating system is shared with our apartment (meaning we get to share the same air as a bunch of strangers). Has anyone else had neighbours abusing/violating social distancing?

33,Staying Positive,https://covid19.camhx.ca/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=83,2020-04-23T11:21:19-04:00,n u,"
I think for a lot of people 2020 was supposed to be the year where everything changed for the better. It was supposed to be a year filled with new experiences, momentous changes and achieving lifelong goals. For me personally, I had this notion in mind that this would be the year where all the plans I laid out would come to fruition through diligence and honing in on the infinite potential that lies within. Then COVID 19 happened. It was an entirely unexpected, unpredictable left turn. Suddenly. all the strategies I had been working on to push my dreams into reality had to be reassessed, if not, put on the back-burner entirely. But even beyond that I knew that so many people around the world have been suffering indescribable losses far beyond my comprehension due to this pandemic. In a way this  can be felt in the air around us. As I've been attempting to adjust to this new routine, there have been ups and downs. An understanding that has helped me stay positive through all of this is realizing that sometimes the medicine that we need to heal us is often bitter. I think that being in isolation is forcing a lot of people to slow down and reassess their own priorities. In my case, it helped me stop and really strengthen my intentions as well as add more details to the goals that I had been visualizing. I only now understand how important this step is in my journey. If I look back at life, I know, beyond a doubt, that the most difficult experiences in my life became the catalyst through which I grew and changed for the better. I find solace in this awareness. Another mental exercise that has helped me is practicing mindfulness. Just last night, I watched a lecture which said that mindfulness is not just breathing or meditating but it is the simple act of being present... entirely present. By this, it means to not focus on the future or the past but to simply soak in where you are right now. If you are eating a piece of fruit for instance, its to notice the fruits sweetness or the fact that you have a chair to sit in and a house that is warm. Perhaps its noticing that the room is quiet and you have time to think. This has deepened my sense of gratitude for the incalculable blessings that exist everywhere. I've also tried to take my previous goals and create micro-goals that I am actually able to work on while in self-isolation. These are just a few thing that have helped me. I hope everyone is staying safe and truly we are all in this together.

Hi,Although my husband is currently working from home and has set up an excellent office for himself in the basement, his boss has been pressuring him to work from the office. My husband’s team member was recently let go so he is in charge of training the new hire, which he is currently doing through phone calls, Skype and screen sharing. His boss believes that the new hire can be trained more efficiently in person, while still maintaining social distancing. My husband has repeatedly tried to explain to his boss that he doesn’t feel safe going into the office and would rather train at home. The new hire feels the same way. Furthermore, in person training would still result in screen sharing since they would be sitting far apart. My husband is feeling immense pressure as he is trying to balance training his co-worker and getting his own work done at a rate that is sufficient for his boss. On the other hand, if he goes into the office, he would only be putting his health and other people’s health at risk. For now his boss let him work from home this week, but will decide the outcome of next week based on his performance.How should he go about dealing with this situation?

Why do I feel more anxious about going to the grocery store than I do about going to work.... I'd rather be at the hospital working those frontlines than going to the grocery store. Also how can some essential places still be open without providing PPE to them.. do employers know this is now community spread.

I realize this is a hard time...it's a lot for many people. Including myself. I've been trying to genuinely focus on some of the positive things that have come from all of this. For example, I've noticed people enjoy being around others more (direct family). I see more kids on my street, and their parents actually playing with them. I see all the different pets on my street that I never have before, and I realize how happy they are to be outside with their owners. I notice the grass is getting greener, and some trees are beginning to sprout their flowers. I notice more squirrels, bunnies, and birds.I have separated myself from the news as much as possible. I've distanced more from social media. And I've kept more in contact with my friends and family. I've begun practicing yoga, going on runs, and caring for my plants.What positive things have you noticed?

I have a 4 year old and we have deliberately not exposed him to screens very much at all. He does not know how phones or iPads work.  He only started watching movies 3 weeks ago (we now do a family movie afternoon once per week).   On average, he watches about 15 minutes per day and this started back in November.  He is very articulate and communicates well with adults and children and is quite advanced for his age, verbally.  The problem now is, well...you all know what the problem now is.  I have meetings to attend and work to do.  He refuses to do any independent play and I don't get even 5 minutes to myself all day. He is an only child.My question is:  what have parents in a similar situation been doing about screen time during Covid-19?  I would love to hear how others' experiences of managing screen time during this stressful time.  Thank you.

Just a question. Wasn't sure where to turn onto ask..I see a psych doctor at Camh regularly  for counselling and meds. Since Covid has started I have not heard from them at all. I emailed once to reach out, but no response and with them being my only support I am feeling left behind and struggling. I heard a few people from programs I have been in that their doctors/workers have reached out to check on them and I am just wondering is this the norm? Are doctors emailing and calling to checking on patients? Or is this something not to expect? Are you all talking to your doctors or like me and left to fend alone? And if you are fending by yourself, how are you getting by? *people say to reach out to your supports, but it's hard when you have 1 friend and 1 doctor for support*

There has been much legitimate attention paid to the shortage of protective gear for medical and nursing staff.But  the people who clean those contaminated spaces where infected patients have worked or visited also cannot get protective gear. They are at risk every day and nobody has even noticed. Nobody is ordering a plane load of gear for them. One of them is my child and I fear for their life.  This person Works in a large site that houses numerous essential businesses and government offices.  And they can’t get  protective gear to clean any of those spaces, even  contaminated sites .  Unionized employees have the right to refuse this unsafe work, but ‘ management ‘ , maybe not. Quite frankly, without custodial staff in every space occupied by people, all of the containment  strategies we are currently using  fail, yet these people are on the  job with minimal or no protective gear every day.  This mum is scared and helpless!

(I had to cancel the flights I had booked for this month’s visit.) In this new world we’re in, my sister and I are completely cut off from our mother except for telephone calls (on which she can’t hear us) during which she expresses her astonishment at the scale of this crisis and her fear that she’ll never see us again before she dies. It’s heartbreaking. I find myself crying all the time - I can’t stop thinking of her. I try to meditate, do mindfulness exercises, focus on my work, etc, but I’m still crying.

There have been so many changes in such a short time. I’m
trying to stay positive but it gets harder the longer time goes on. I have my
own things to deal with, but then I’m also feeling mentally drained from
trying to be caring for my friends and family who are being laid off work
and having anxiety about what they should and shouldn’t do to prevent getting
or spreading the virus. 
I’m finding that a few things are helping me, like: trying
to remind myself of the silver linings or the things I am grateful for,
connecting with friends through social media or texting, watching dog videos. I limit how much news I'm watching, and try to find videos that have nothing to do with what we are going through. The 30-60minutes of distraction have been such a relief. I’ve
had to stop clicking on COVID memes on social media too because I was feeling
so overwhelmed and sad. Now I click on cute animal posts or posts about my
favourite shows. Luckily Instagram is intuitive and now my feed is a bit better
for my mental health. I also try to get some sunshine (near a window, by the
door, or short walks) when I can.

          I was not vaccinated and got hit hard by Covid. I am a 60 year old female. After nearly 3 years of super cautious behavior, I wonder if the new very contagious strain is what got me. 
 At lunch I was fine and by dinner I had the worst headache of my life, couldn't eat, and temp reached 102 at 1 am, the next day going up to 102.7 Tested positive on rapid covid antigen test  I also felt like i had knife blades in my throat and my nose and throat were quite congested. I was nauseous and could not eat for a whole week. Urine output was minimal although i was drinking a fair amount of water. Temp fell and then rose again but not to as high a level. Remained feeling very ill and congested Noticed throughout my heart rate was elevated but i attributer that both to fever and dehydration. After a week i started eating but remained very congested. My pulse ox meter did not show any dip in oxygen saturation at fingertip. I was encouraged to go to ER for fluids but I did not go despite being close. I felt very sick. 
 Its now been two and a half weeks since covid onset and I've noticed something odd about my heart. First i saw on pulse oximeter that not only had it remained higher than usual, but it would speed up then slow down then speed up then slow down. It was not a stable rhythm. I used my kardia monitor  and also payed for membership to get the advanced feature of a graph of the R-R interval. It was highly variable and Was able to determine that this was a a sinus arrhythmia. So not a fib or flutter but varying rhythm . Docs have been frustrating on this. If you look this up, you'll find  it is fine if you are a kid but if you are older and get it as an adult, it usually signifies heart disease  i do not know if mine is respiratory or non- respiratory sinus arrhythmia but either way  in older adult indicates an underlying problem. Very frustrating to have a doc instead say “normal variant” despite this and despite never having it before. 
 Before covid i had Sjogrens Syndrome, dysautonomia, and a mast cell issue , so not in the best of health and knew i would get hit hard 
 Currently , besides heart (also 25 beats higher than normal) , temp still a degree higher than usual, lots of sinus pressure, anosmia, intense rib pain apparently  from a few coughing fits, Headaches, sleeping alot, eating alot, and i Don't feel back to my usual self yet. I assume too soon for long covid 
 Anyone else experience a heart change? And  still there 2.5 weeks past onset? It might be easy to miss this one if one weren't obsessively checking pulse ox meter. and noticed the odd jumping around was different than usual. Any  comments? Input would be helpful. Will i feel better? What about the body temp and headaches? Etc. Thanks for any help. I don't have enough stories to know  how typical or atypical my case was, especially from unvaccinated older people   Would be helpful to compare. Thanks

As of February 2022, the syndrome was estimated to affect about 16 million adults in the U.S. and had forced between two million and four million Americans out of the workforce, many of whom have yet to return. Long COVID often arises in otherwise healthy young people, and it can follow even a mild initial infection. 
A meta-analysis of 41 studies conducted in 2021 concluded that worldwide, 43 percent of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 may develop long COVID, with about 30 percent—translating to approximately 30 million people—affected in the U.S. Some studies have offered more conservative numbers. A June 2022 survey reported by the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics found that among adults who had had COVID, one in five was experiencing long COVID three months later; the U.K. Office for National Statistics put the estimate at one in 10. Even if only a small share of infections result in long COVID, experts say, they will add up to millions more people affected—and potentially disabled.

          I work in the Internet industry in the UK. I suffered from depression three years ago. I was basically cured before I was infected with the new crown in November 2021. I have stopped using antidepressants. But after being infected with the new crown, the depression relapsed again. The doctor judged that it was one of the symptoms of the new crown, brain fog, which continued.
 After getting the new crown, I felt that I was ""brain-dead"", I didn't want to do anything, and I felt extremely anxious. It started with cold-like symptoms, headache, cough, fever, and loss of taste and smell. Chest tightness, shortness of breath, fatigue, insomnia, loss of appetite, forgetfulness, difficulty concentrating, unresponsiveness, and anxiety also occur.
 The whole situation is not good. I lost four kilograms in weight. All four members of my family were infected with the new crown, one after another. I couldn’t live a normal life for about a month. Apart from feeling tired all the time, the two children recovered relatively quickly, but daily life such as food and clothing needed to be taken care of, and I felt that life was fragmented and messed up, and I couldn't cope at all.
 I remember that I had a cough for three weeks, was bedridden for a month, and then took a long sick leave for more than three months. I simply can't afford to get out of bed to cook, the kids eat takeout every day and they have mouth sores for a long time. Fortunately, there are friends who help and often send us home-made delicacies. At that time, volunteers from the community also sent me antidepressants to my home to ensure that I could take them in time. My family doctor advised me to ask a counselor again.
 The biggest push for me was a few home visits by the social worker in charge of child welfare. The well-intentioned help made me extremely anxious and insomnia. I felt that I was an incompetent mother who couldn't even do the most basic things to take care of my children. Does the new crown make me a useless person! This is unacceptable to me.
 The regular doctor's consultation and the kind greetings from the leaders of the unit also made me feel like a burden, and I didn't want to be sick all the time. This day-to-day burnout and bedriddenness made me feel worthless.
 For a long time, I thought I had Alzheimer's. I can't remember anything, and I look for things every day. What the doctor said has to be asked several times over and over again to understand. Sometimes after calling in the morning to confirm, call again in the afternoon and ask again. Later, when I was browsing the web, I noticed in longcovidcarecenter that my symptoms may belong to post covid brain fog, and I checked many papers here to confirm my guess.
 Sometimes I don't know if I have taken medicine or not. Going into the kitchen, I forgot what I was going to do. Looking at the pills with a glass of water, I asked myself if I just took the medicine or didn’t take it?
 Because of the confusion caused by many small things, I deeply doubted my ability to handle things. She feels that she must first learn to forgive herself and accept herself who is often tired and forgetful.
 Family doctors and psychologists believe that the new crown and its chain effects have become an inducement for the recurrence of depression, and the dose of antidepressants needs to be increased.
 It has been five months since the dose was increased, and the effect is obvious. She is recovering, but she still has symptoms of anxiety and fatigue, and her physical strength has not yet fully recovered. Now I want to start with doing one small thing every day, to be happier and stay optimistic. Doctors hope to gradually taper off the antidepressants over the course of a year.

          Hi everyone, I tested positive for Covid on Monday of this week having exhibited symptoms on Sunday but I was not testing positive until the following day. My wife and her sisters went on a vacation to Florida and brought it up with back with them.  I had a sore throat Sunday and Monday and that was about it. I did try paxlovid on Monday night and had to DC Tuesday am due to a horrible, horrible stomach ache and nausea. I also found out that it was contraindicated for many medications including one I was taking (doctor didn’t mention and had to contact about what to do) I was wondering a couple things. Is this usually how it goes for those who have it mild or does it progress further at this point and does anyone here deal with any anxiety and did this make your covid experience worse for you? It has not helped mine at all lol. Thank you for any and all answers. As a side note I am vaccinated and boosted x1 as it we want until recently they made a second booster available for my age group.

          Hello, I have been looking for answers for a long time. I had Covid last November. During the time I had it (12-14 days) I had shortness of breath, muscle aches all over, and loss of taste and smell. I’m sure I’m missing a few things!
 Ever since, I got pain in my neck, back, legs severely and genital pain. 
 In April I began to have stinging pain, which eventually covered my whole body. Now I have full blown peripheral neuropathy all over. Very bad pain in my legs and tailbone area, blurred vision, and my body vibrates uncontrollably.
 I’m 27 and was a bodybuilder until this started happening.
 I’ve had every single test done that doctors could think of. Every blood test, mri, xrays, cat scans, ct scans, emgs etc. they’re finding nothing.
 Has anyone had these symptoms? They can’t diagnose me. 
 If anyone knows anything I would greatly appreciate it.

          From the limited news I have heard about the worst-case Coronavirus symptoms, the lungs seem to fill with fluid making the ventilators not work effectively enough. Why not avoid aggravating the lungs by ""working with"" the symptoms by filling the lungs with high-Oxygen liquid? I had heard that Liquid Breathing is used in neonatal using PFOs. Otherwise, can we look at supersaturating water (or another common liquid) with Oxygen like we use in Agriculture (CO2Gro or Moleaer)?
 What am I missing, other than actual medical knowledge (a large gap in itself) with this as an option?

          I had a mild Covid infection in late Feb 2022. On day 5 I developed horrible psychosis, depression, physical and mental anxiety, burning sensation on the top of my head and heart and twitching muscles. It’s been 6 months now and symptoms have improved. I feel maybe 85-90% most days and the psychosis and depression is gone THANK GOD but I randomly get the burning sensation on my scalp that is always accompanied by a physical anxiety feeling in my core. Has anyone dealt with these symptoms post Covid? I’ve tried supplements for neurotransmitters, Omega 3s, Hyperbaric Oxygen, Acupuncture, CBD, Kava, GABA, l-theanine and St. John’s wort and breathing techniques. Hyperbaric oxygen was the most helpful but it’s inconvenient to do regularly. Would love to know if anyone has had success treating these symptoms with any other methods.

          I am 10 weeks post covid now with some breathing difficulties ( not sure of cause yet) seeing an ENT specialist and diagnosed rhinitus so far( inflammed nose-narrowed nasal passageways ) waiting for ct scan results for sinuses . Symptoms now are congested nose ,some headaches, runny nose after food/exercise (runny nose and post nasal drip have lessened due to nasal spray - dymista) some difficulty breathing on waking ,going to bed and occasionally on exercise. Fully fit and healthy before covid -no breathing probelms ever .Any suggestions as I am really worreid about my breathing ! I have tried resting more at times and sleeping sitting more upright, eating slowly to avoid breathlessness and nothing seems to stop these symptoms which vary a lot from hour to hour and day to day.I expected to recover from covid easily as I have never had any health problems at all in 51 years ( 3 covid vaccinations) no medical history of any other conditions and fit and healthy working out 6-7 days a week for the last 17.5 years working in the fitness industry.I presume my symptoms are linked to covid as I did not experience them before this.I need a  lot of help to get me through this - I do not want to be dismisse das just another case of rhinitus and left to suffer with a nasal spry when there is so much more involved in this .Any help /advice from personal /medical experience welcome thnak you!

          So it seems like one of the early symptoms of Coronavirus is digestive issues, mainly diarrhea, as per a few articles that came out today:
 https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-digestive-symptoms-diarrhea-almost-half-of-patients/
 I wanted to share this because about a month ago, I started to experience daily digestive issues and the main symptom was diarrhea. At first I thought it was something I ate, then I thought it was my medication no working due (I am a chronic hepatitis B patient) because when I was dealing with that virus when it became active, it was similar symptoms. Lack of appetite, odd fatigue & weird sleep patterns, weight loss and muscle wasting, diarrhea, etc.
 Anyway, I was going on for a month like this and that is how I felt, that some virus was attacking my system. It eventually slowed down to almost nothing today and this past week, and everything is sort of going back to normal (I do have a cough that has been around for a week, and a stuffed up nose, but these too are subsiding). 
 Anyway, I wanted to share this because all tests I took, nothing was able to be found with me. And it seems like this may be what I had... though doctor refused to give me a test because I was not presenting with chills & fever. I wanted to make everyone aware as it seems like the common symptoms are not the only ones. I'm planning to make a full recover at this time, within the next week.

          If someone regularly wears a high quality mask but frequently handles the mask improperly - i.e., grabbing the front of the mask to pull it down in order to blow their nose, wipe their face, etc. - how harmful is that? Are they still generally safe given that they’re wearing a highly protective mask? Does repeatedly handling the “contaminated” part of the mask practically negate the purpose of wearing one? What if the person touches the mask with one hand and blows their nose with the other? I’d appreciate some clarity on this. Thank you.

          Hey all, so I’m based in India where over the past month or so, there has been an uptick in infections which is pointing to a new wave that’s underway.
 I managed to not catch COVID in first three waves (or maybe I didn’t show any symptoms, I dunno), but tested positive on June 13th. I went through 2-3 days of 101 F fever, general tiredness, but was fine shortly afterwards. There was a lingering scratchyness in the throat, coupled with a stuffy (not runny) nose for a few days, but that also is largely gone. I took a test today that showed I’m negative now.
 I checked my weight today and realised I had dropped a fairly significant amount this month. Going through my phone’s health app, I realised that I was at 118.4 kgs / 261 lbs on June 3rd which has now come down to 113 kgs / 249 lbs.
 Barring a few days, I have generally been eating a very low calorie and clean diet. Plus the last couple of days, have been eating slightly less since my stomach was upset.
 My questions:
 - Have folks with COVID experienced similar weight loss in a short time?
 - Is a 5.4 kg / 12 lbs drop over a 25 day period that overlapped with a 12 day COVID period normal for an (overweight) guy like me?
 Thanks in advance for your responses!

It's since come back to some extent but isn't the same.  Things smell very weird, off, faint or not at all and lots of things taste really bad (like bug spray). So, I got something to try and wanted to know if anyone else has heard of this.  I listened to a radio program about it and it is retraining your smell. I purchased a smell training kit online.  Pretty cheap. But it has four scents and I'm supposed to expose myself to them for a few seconds twice a day. What exactly this will do, I have no idea.  ha.  I'm charting it.Lemon is very faint.  Rose is strange. Anyway, hoping this helps as it is being recommended by doctors for those who have long term loss of scent from covid 19

          Do we use up our vaccine antibodies each time we are exposed to covid?
 I ask this because I have recently been exposed to covid on a daily basis whilst caring for an elderly relative. I managed to stay negative for a whole week before eventually testing positive. Then I went down hill rapidly. There is no doubt I was exposed for days, because I had my relative practically coughing in my face for days. It felt as though my vaccine antibodies (last booster 4 months ago) were keeping the virus at bay until all my antibodies were used up and then I just caught it big time. In fact I was really quite ill. Worse than my elderly relative. The WHO has this to say about vaccine lifespan…
 “Immunity may reduce faster in people who are older or who have underlying medical conditions, or who have a high level of exposure to the virus”
 It is this last part that I find interesting and is quite important for carers who may be exposed to covid over an extended period.

          I had Omicron in mid December, like so many others. My biggest symptoms were night sweats, muscle aches (mostly back pain), fatigue, and some fever. 
 I'm not sick anymore, obviously, but is anyone else still experiencing muscle aches and fatigue? My back still hurts, though it's better than it was, but the fatigue - I can barely make it through the day. 
 Thanks :)

          hello. I wish everyone good health. I had fever (103) on 23 and 25 January. I got tested and came to know that I am positive. I had flu symptoms, headache, dizziness. After two days, fever went back to normal. I got tested on 1 Feb and result came back as negative. My flu symptoms are still there and dizziness is at its peak, along with cold hands. Why my flu is still there? I am an anxiety patient and been to emergency multiple times in the past due to cardiac anxiety.Please tell me about your post covid symptoms. Thank you in advance

          I am at the moment Covid-19 pos so I chose to post here however I don’t need to have covid for this to occur but for it to get as bad as I will talk about here I need to have a respiratory infection of some kind. I also have Sjögren’s syndrome which has me taking a steroid inhaler twice a day so I can breathe in the cold winter air. No asthma apparently but always get phlegm and coughy when I laugh hard or run a shorter distance. 
 I was picked up by an ambulance and brought to the emergency room earlier this week because it was hard to breathe. Basically I was panting because my body told me too and whenever I tried to slow down my breathing it feels like when you’re holding your breath. The ambulance and emergency room found my O2 saturation at 100% and my blood gas showed signs of hyperventilation. Now this doesn't and didn’t surprise me at all as I can feel that I am getting enough oxygen, as long as I am panting. The first time this happened during another infection I had pre-corona the emergency room all thought I was having a panic attack. That is absolutely not what is happening. I have had them in the past, they’re completely different and don’t last for 6-8 hours. 
 EKG was good. Blood gas good. As I managed to slow my breathing down more and more without feeling like I was going to suffocate my saturation sank and eventually the panting stopped completely and I had a saturation at 93-94%. According to the hospital staff, my saturation should still be bad even with the panting if that was the problem. I argue that my body obviously is panting for a reason. It’s basically very laborsome to fill my lungs. 
 Am I missing something here? Is my logic really not valid? And what words am I supposed to use to explain how I feel to avoid the panic attack label? And why would I suddenly feel shortness of breath if I have no trouble saturating?
 Thank you for reading this far. While I’m just thankful I don’t need medical help, I want to understand what I am going through.

112,Post-Covid Breathing issues,https://www.medhelp.org/posts/COVID19/Post-Covid-Breathing-issues/show/3069015,2022-01-19T13:26:02-05:00,adwysh8367,"

          I was infected with covid in aug. 2020 and then again in dec 2021.  The first time I had covid, symptoms were very mild, brief sinus headache and congestion but also had mild difficulty taking deep breaths, it was a tightness in the chest.  All my symptoms were gone in a few days except for the chest tightness and that weird issue where sometimes taking a deep breath was hard.  It got better over the next year or so but recurred on occasion (maybe once a week or so for a few hours). 
When I got covid in Dec 2021, I had no symptoms except my chest again felt a little tight and the breathing issue became more frequent, every day. Mind you its not a major issue, but I am concerned about permanently damaging my lungs. The question I have is, would it be ok to go back to my normal workout routine (Crossfit, i.e. high intensity aerobic workouts) or will I possibly wreck my lungs? How long should i wait?  Anyone else had this issue?
 The strange thing is my symptoms were SO mild but my chest is still experiencing tightness 1 month later (after my 2nd infection). Welcome any comments from those who may had a similar experience.
 For background, I am a 29 yr old male, in great health and in excellent physical condition, I work out 5x or more per week at a crossfit gym.

          I contracted COVID two times - October 2020 and in April 2021. Ever since then I’ve been dealing with episodes of hypothermia at unexpected times. My body temperature drops as low as 90° Fahrenheit sometimes and during this time I start to lose consciousness. My body feels lethargic, I have high blood pressure and eventually I start sweating. All this episode takes 10-20 minutes, sometimes even longer. This happens post exertion as well as when I’m resting or taking a nap. Indications of these episodes are sweating, dizziness, body ache, and trepidation.
 This has affected my lifestyle immensely. I’m only 18 years old. I had these episodes during my final exams as well. I’m also experiencing loss of appetite. Eating heavy or fried foods also cause these episodes. The only thing that helps out is a strong black tea or consuming warm milk or water.
 We’ve conducted each and very body test possible, been to numerous doctors and no core problem was ruled out. Basic medication to improve immune system and some antibiotics were prescribed each time and none of it improved my situation. I want to know if anybody else has dealt with a situation like this? What remedies helped them? And if there’s any doctor to help me deal with this specific condition?

          I have a family of six. We think we got exposed around the new year or eve. My oldest daughter (10) woke up with a headache on Tuesday 1/4. Tested positive on PCR with sample taken on 1/6. Mine came negative. I am vaccinated and boosted. My younger daughter (7), my wife and my olde son (5) took PCR on 1/7, all negative. All of us took RAPID antigen on Saturday 1/8. My daughters both came positive, the rest of us including our youngest son (21 months) came negative. What to do now? When should we retest? My younger daughter’s negative PCR but positive rapid the next day is puzzling. With 4 young children, isolation is not easy. Masking at home would have been possible but we gave up on it eventually. 
 Most important thing - none of us has any symptoms at this time.

          I didn’t think much but last month I went to a wedding and was playing with a few kids. One for for sure sounded sick, stuffy nose slight fever. I would say a few days later I came down with itchy throat slight fever then a horrible cough that lasted a couple weeks. I lost my sense of smell/taste for a day or 2 with diarrhea  but not sure from the stuffy nose. I was in Hawaii at the time and just stayed in my room but didnt take the pcr. I would say I never was fatigue or a crazy high fever. I am also fully vaccinated.

          I (26F) and my daughter had both tested positive for COVID last month. It has been almost six weeks since I tested positive for COVID. It has been three weeks since my daughter tested positive for COVID. I tested positive for COVID with both a home test and a PCR test before I really noticed symptoms. My daughter tested negative at first, and then positive later. I tested negative on a home test a little over three weeks after I first tested positive. My daughter tested negative on a home test a few days after I tested negative on the home test. We both went to the doctor two days ago, and they tested both of us using a PCR COVID test, and we were negative. They also tested her for a lot of other viruses, and they detected rhinovirus, adenovirus, and human metapneumovirus. We went back yesterday, because my daughter was throwing up. She gets ear infections frequently, so I was worried she had one. They didn't check her ears at the first appointment. They did find that she had an ear infection at the appointment we went to yesterday. They put her on an antibiotic. I am really worried about my child. I am also worried about what I am going through. Even before COVID, I suffered from frequent sinus issues (headaches, pressure, post nasal drip), GERD, pleurisy, muscle and joint pain, etc. I am currently experiencing pain in my legs, fingers, ankles, wrists, arms, and all of my head. I have pressure in my face. I can feel the mucus in my throat. I have a sour taste in my throat. My chest is heavy. It feels like someone has their hand over my mouth and nose. I have pressure and pain in my abdomen and back (I also experienced this before COVID). I am really scared. Do you all think that the tests were accurate? I just hope that we both truly are negative for COVID now.

          I was tested positive December 27th. December 25th &26th, I had symptoms as follows Muscle aches Fever of 101 at its peak Severe sore throat December 27th -29th wet cough and sore throat. I’m unvaccinated and I have serious anxiety issues. I have a sense of doom that’s indescribable. The day I tested positive someone from my high school which was a 42 year old male died from Covid bc he was placed on a ventilator. Now all I can worry about is having the same fate. I literally am wearing a oxygen meter 24/7 watching my levels which are an average of 97. My wet cough concerns me but it has improved. I feel ok today. Weak but moving around. I had a moment of trouble breathing but I emailed a doctor and they Asked my oxygen and it was literally 98-100 at the time of my breathing episode. I contributed it to my anxiety. Tomorrow I will go to urgent care and ask for a catscan but idk if that’s crazy. On top of all of this my girlfriend just recovered from Covid 15 days ago and today she’s feeling sick bc after she quarantined I visited her and I then became sick . Any advice from anyone would be greatly appreciated. My biggest fear is obviously death. Idk if I’m being irrational but Covid is scarier. Being sick is scary.

Idk if it’s possible for things to turn around now because I have improved n my concern is that things go back to bad because reading online articles say mild symptoms can turn into severe on 5-10 days . My symptoms day 1,2,3,4 were not really mild I’d say . Fever , wet cough and fatigue in bed , groggy and def sick . Day 5 was a huge improvement and now day 6 I’m dry coughing a bit but I’m up n moving around . Started sneezing a bit but I’m still okay . My oxygen is 97-99 and no fever as of this morning .  Being anxious is the worst bc all I can think about it the worst case scenario . I’m a 37 year old male with no bone chronic or underlying conditions . Clearly anxiety n fear . That’s chronic . I’m no doctor but I know I feel much better than the first 4 days but I’m not 100% and that scares me that I’m not out of this thing yet and scared for my lungs  .

          On August 12, 2021 I received my 1st moderna dose. Within a few minutes I had the sensation of pins and needles passing back and forth across my body. At about 15 minutes I was nauseous. By the evening i had diarrhea. The next morning when I woke up my left arm (injection arm) was extremely painful, The pain extended down my arm into my elbow and wrist and my grip strength was diminished. 
 The pain continued to expand out across my body and into my hips, legs, neck, chest, feet, pretty much every where. My skin buzzed and I had internal tremors. I felt like I was plugged into an electrical outlet. My eyes were inflamed and blurry, my ear were ringing very loudly, I became sun sensitive and it felt like my skin was burning and itchy at the same time. I would sweat very much with very little exertion. My legs were shaky and buckled as I walked. I had extreme pain all over my body with sharp pressure points in several areas including my neck, throat, back/ shoulders, low back, elbows, knees, feet etc. I even had seizures for a few nights. (not grand maul but my body would cramp up and start shaking and shivering uncontrollably). My blood pressure which was borderline high skyrocketed to 198/105 and stayed in the 190's/100's for a few weeks. Anxiety was high, depression setting in, memory and thinking were diminished. Did I mention sharp abdominal pain when pressed?
 These symptoms progressed for a little over three months and then finally started to subside. As a result of my falling and instability I did get a labral tear in my right hip. Throughout this I have been seen by my general practitioner, rheumatologist orthopedist and yes a psychiatrist for the severe anxiety, depression and cognitive issues. I have had a myriad of blood work completed  for inflammatory markers and autoimmune indicators which all returned normal except as follows;
 ANA - positive
ANCA  ANTIBODIES - positive
ATYPICAL P-ANCA TITER - elevated above normal range (1:32 titer  standard less than 1:20 titer)
AST - higher than normal
Chloride - lower than normal
 So far I get the I don't know, don't worry answer. Maybe you have fibromyalgia. But this is not likely related to the moderna vaccine. You should probably see a cardiologist.
 Anyone have any thoughts? I hurt all over and everything is tingly, burny and such.

          There is a bit of bad publicity about it in terms of people reporting issues after getting the booster.  But now they are recommending that everyone does and soon with the new variant.  My question is that if one of the things they are reporting is that these new variants are 'outsmarting' our vaccines, is there a point?  Especially if the booster is associated with more adverse events? I have a doctor's appointment this week so will get the 411 for myself but to booster or not to booster. That's the question. Had covid.  Had full dosing of the Pfizer vaccine. I do have a couple of risk factors making me slightly higher risk.

131,Future of not being afraid of covid?,https://www.medhelp.org/posts/COVID19/Future-of-not-being-afraid-of-covid/show/3068329,2021-12-08T10:14:32-05:00,specialmom,"

          So, there is some science to support that Covid will peter out.   Viruses, in general, become less virulent over time. Because if they remain deadly, they kill off their hosts and have no place to replicate and spread. Kind of interesting thought.  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095397/  Title of the article:  We shouldn’t worry when a virus mutates during disease outbreaks.  Mutations are an expected part of virology and often, they become less severe as it happens. Would be good news. Seems to be the case for the new covid variant out of South Africa as it is being said to be less severe.  Obviously not getting comfortable or anything, scheduled for my booster next week. But would be great news if this is the case as who doesn't want to see an end of the threat of covid world wide??

          When I have a respiratory infection, and I have had many, the last thing in the world I feel like doing is lying down flat in bed. In that position I feel like a crockpot drowning in fluid which is slowly petrifying..  
 Many of the photos on TV show people flat, or maybe raised up 10degrees, in the hospital on vents.
 I said to Mom 'Promise me you won't let them lower the head of my bed below 45 degrees if I am ever in this situation.""

          just have a question, I took the Pfizer 15th September, I ended up in emergency ward with chest pain and so on, I had abnormality on the ecg which needed monitoring. I was released with follow up with cardiologist, however exactly on the 2 week of the vaccine I developed some sort of skin rash, started a few red spots on my thigh which went on to be a full blown spots everywhere, thighs lower legs, never seen anything like it, it looks like Petechiae, doesn’t change colour under the glass, I went to the emergency agin they said it’s from shaving after I specifically told the Moron I didn’t  shave. I went to two gp, non knew what it was only that my blood work is good. I called adverse reaction line they said yes it probably is from vaccine. Has anyone had anything like this happen to them? If so how long did it take to go? I have taken antihistamine but nothing is helping it. I really don’t want the second dose since I have had such a hard time with the first. I’m also right now scared of what other side effects the vaccine can bring on, last night I had pin and needles in my hand and forearm , I don’t know if that’s just from my sleeping position.

 1. Does any chance to transmit HIV? 
 2. I am a COVID positive 3 months back and rcovered, and now it's my turn for COVID vaccination. I am going to vaccinate ( Covisheild vaccination) Does this COVID vaccination delays HIV test or window period of HIV test or delayed produce HIV antibody?

 I am an illegal immigrant in India (an asylum seeker) and I'm beginning to have some symptoms, but I can't go to the doctor or register to be vaccinated, due to the fear of being deported. So I've just self-quarantined. I'm having some fruits to help my immune system, but my question is, does Azithromycin help?
 I have absolutely no knowledge of medicine. Is there a chance that taking Azithromycin could only suppress the virus for a while, giving it the chance to evolve and become even more dangerous? I mean delta is already pretty dangerous. I don't know if Azithromycin would only make it worse.
 I'm sorry if my question is too dumb. And thanks in advance.

          I had a letter today from the NHS here in the UK, an invitation to get vaccinated.
In this area they vaccinate with Astrazeneca, in a town 1 hour away they use Pfizer.
 So many conflicting reports make me anxious and confused, on many NHS pages on social media you get comments directing you to the government site MHRA where a lot of people have listed side effects of the vaccines.
Scare stories of blood clots and horrible feelings after taking them including heart problems make it seem risky. 
People being described as ""sheep"" and downplaying of covid makes it all confusing, especially when there aee some ""medical professionals"" start making claims against covid or the vaccine.
 I've had the flu before and survived, had the flu jab once and felt horrible for a couple of weeks, achy and headaches and pain in the arm.
 Had tetanus jabs and for typhoid but didn't react to them. 
Still anxious to know how I'd react to the covid vaccines.
 Does the vaccine have bad effects on people with high blood pressure and heart conditions? Those who had angina?
 I always try to keep myself healthy and go for walk also sometimes cycling.

          This page is updated regularly with data provided by US states, for states that report these statistics.  In what is not likely to be a surprising revelation, most of the severe and deadly infections are occurring in those who are not fully vaccinated.

 I've seen and heard too may people say that it doesn't matter if you get vaccinated or not, because you could still get COVID either way.  Statements like this are known as ""false equivalency,"" made on the bad faith assumption that the two choices have equal merit/outcomes.  While it's true that vaccinated individuals *can* contract COVID and *can* get severe COVID, the level of health and life risk is not even close to equal among the two groups.

          I am going to get vaccinated with Pfizer in a week.
 Do I need to consult with allergist before I get a shot?
 about 9 years ago, I got Measles vaccine and had a very strong reaction - High temperature, rash etc..
 I've not had any serious allergies after that.
Can I just go ahead and get vaccinated or should I consult doctor first. 
As far as I know, I'm not allergic. I sometimes have a small rash in summer when I sweat but it goes away in couple of hours.

          My mom has been having trouble with COVID 19 and went to the ER to get checked out this saturday. She is 67 and 87 Lbs and a very small person (4 foot something). She's had her symptoms since the 20th and the ER doc said that 'you are technically out of the window but I can approve the antibodies"". She's not vaccinated.
 There was argument with the hospital as they wouldn't initially do it as she'd be > 10 days but they eventually did it. She's now scheduled and it will be 15 or 16 days since symptoms when getting this.
 Reading the paperwork on the infusion it says you should be at least 88 lbs and symptoms < 10 days.
 * Why do they have the 10 day limit? Is it just to ensure consistency of the study, rationing, or is it a legitimate waste or harmful to get it after 10 days. I would think it can help her somewhat.
* Is it harmful to get it if under 88 lbs?

          I had covid 6 months ago!  I still have less acute smell and altered taste. I know how food should taste (eating is something I take seriously!) and smell.  I have read that there is a nerve that becomes inflamed (why we lose smell) and it can take some time to get back to normal. But am wondering WHEN?!  Will it be like this forever and I will never appreciate my favorite perfume, my pumpkin spice Yankee candle, dinner cooking deliciuosly on the stove?  Will things that used to taste good to me always for now on have an offputting taste instead?  I do smell 'some' and taste.  But it's not back to normal.

          Hi, I have just taken the first dose. I had sore arm around 5-10 minutes after being vaccinated, which is common. 
 However, I started feeling something was off after going back home. I noticed the same smell was at least 10x stronger than what I would normally feel. I find myself able to hear details of every sound, even if they are soft or located far away. Sounds also seem louder than it used to.
 I was unable to enjoy certain foods due to its extraordinary strong taste compared to before I took the vaccine, but certain foods taste much more delicious than usual. 
 Is hyper sensitivity a common symptom post vaccination? What could be the cause of this? Will it get better?

          Hi. I have been having sore throat, dry throat and dry cough for the past week. I have no other symptoms of Covid-19 and I have not gotten tested yet. 
 I have Sinusitis and considered as a high-risk person. I'm living with my family, and so far they hadn't developed any flu-like symptoms yet. 
 I'm currently very afraid of catching the virus and had anxiety and panic attack over it. I know that the symptoms can be really severe and fatal, which has made me worried even more about it. I've seen Covid-19 survivors talked about their experiences, which has made me worried even more. 
 I have two question: What are the chance of me getting infected with the virus?
 Do you know of any mental support group that could allow me to interact with others, so I'll get less worried. 
 I have no mental support or friends to share this with right now. 
 I'm extremely worried of catching Covid-19 or passing it to my family. Some of them are high risk members. I cannot afford to. 
 If I did, I would probably blame myself over it. I already had some suicidal thoughts right now.

          My wife has gotten the Covid 19 vaccination, and during conversation I said that the babies also vaccinated. I was corrected by my friend who said that the baby isn't vaccinated, instead it got its antibodies from intrauterine absorption from the mother.
 The definition of being vaccinated means obtaining antibodies via a vaccine. My wife got the vaccine, made antibodies, and the antibodies went to the child. It says nothing about being the one getting the shot. So that would literally be the child getting antibodies from the vaccination like the definition says so. I argued that it can be true that the baby got its immunities from the vaccination AND intrauterine absorption as the second is just a process.
 I have a few questions:
 Why wouldn't this be the same thing as saying my child vaccinated? They are antibodies obtained via a vaccination, like the definition.
 The way the covid vaccinations are different right? It trains your DNA to make the antibodies. So wouldn't that also go to the unborn baby through the ambilocal chord since its not like traditional vaccines that use dead or weaker bacteria/viruses?
 I know its an annoying nit pick, but I want to know.

I recently visited my PCP for some low back pain that I was having that is most likely related to arthritis from an L5-S1 spinal fusion surgery that I had in 2011. My PCP gave me an injection of dexamethasone sodium phosphate to try and help with the inflammation and pain. It seemed to work as the pain has subsided completely, and I only had minor side effects such as body temperature increase and some injection site swelling. Both side effects subsided after about 24 hours. Does this shot make me more susceptible to COVID and other viral/bacterial infections? And if so, for how long?

She is taking steam inhalation and drinking hot water also along with multivitamins, Zincovit and Vit-C tablets and home remedies like drinking luke warm lemon water or turmeric milk. She is in home isolation but still after 14 days  there is not not much improvement so she went for Covid RT-PCR, CT-Scan and blood test. After 14 days of initial symptoms, her CT-scan score is 5/25, RT-PCT score is 22, CRP protein 2.83 mg/L, platelets 220 thousands/uL, oxymeter Spo2 95-96. She took azithromycin for 10 days now she is taking only paracetamol. But there is not much improvement in SPO2. Fever and weakness is still same. Is there any complications. Is she recovering or not. What medications or precautions should be taken.

          I took some Tylenol before the vaccine, and my sister later told me that I shouldn’t have. I did some research, and it said there wasn’t much research about how that might affect the covid vaccine. It said that it’s okay to take Tylenol or ibuprofen afterwards but not before.  Will Tylenol or any NSAID prevent a person’s body from producing antibodies against the virus? I took the Pfizer vaccine, the first dose. I won’t take any Tylenol for the second vaccine dose, but just curious if I affected the first dose’s efficacy?

          I'm asking a question on behalf of my mother, since she doesn't speak English.
She's 52 years old and has had discoid lupus (lupus erythematosus discoides) for 7 years now. Naturally, since it's an autoimmune disease, she's worried about whether she can get vaccinated against COVID19 or not. She had asked one doctor (not an immunologist though) but he hasn't given her a clear answer. She also has not been able to reach an immunologist since it's hard to reach doctors for non-emergencies or non-COVID issues anywhere now.
 She's currently not taking any treatment for the lupus, as her condition is generally well. The only thing she takes are some antioxidants and amino-acid supplements.
 So is there any reason to worry about the vaccine for someone with discoid lupus?
 Thanks in advance.

          The CDC recently recommended that we double mask, wearing a disposable mask under a cloth mask.

What are your thoughts?For more on this - https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7007e1.htmhttps://www.nbcnews.com/shopping/wellness/cdc-double-masking-n1257287

          Both of the following statements are on the CDC website on pages updated within the past week and a half:
 1: COVID-19 Cases are Extremely High. Avoid Events and Gatherings. COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths are extremely high across the United States. To decrease your chance of getting and spreading COVID-19, CDC recommends that you do not gather with people who do not live with you at this time. Attending events and gatherings increases your risk of getting and spreading COVID-19. Stay home to protect yourself and others from COVID-19. (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/holidays.html)
 2: Evidence suggests that many K-12 schools that have strictly implemented mitigation strategies have been able to safely open for in-person instruction and remain open. (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/operation-strategy.html)
 Well which is it? I don't understand why, given certain criteria and and mitigation strategies are satisfied, it is supposed be safe to send my younger child into a public classroom most of the day, every day, yet it is absolutely not safe to see my other child who just left home shortly before the pandemic, even rigorously using all the same mitigation strategies, and with community spread being equal. It just doesn't seem to add up.
 To better frame my question, first consider my family still at home: Either my wife or I (not both) buys groceries once a week, at the time we believe is the least busy hour of the week. We carefully select and always use PPE based on the best information available. My son is in virtual school, and I work from home, except for rare occasions where it is necessary to go to work to perform my job, and then I follow strict social distancing and all the recommended Covid PPE and safety guidelines. We do get curbside pickup or go through the drive through a couple times a week. Otherwise, we never leave the house except for walks where we will not even be likely to encounter other pedestrians, or for essential doctor visits, or oddball one-off situations, like when we had to have a tire repair. Unfortunately this is against a backdrop of COVID-19 not being taken seriously in the surrounding community, with many acting as though there were no pandemic. Of course our strategies do really minimize encountering such people, but we can't reduce it to zero.
 Now, I don't have a good feel as to whether we have reduced our risk 70%, 90%, 98%, or even to near zero compared to someone who does not take COVID-19 seriously. Do the experts have a good idea to what the risk would be to people with our lifestyle, or are we still at a point where there is still not enough research or information so that anyone really knows the answer to that question? If there is a good, evidence based estimate on how much the risk is reduced for a family like ours, what would that be?
 And what is really the risk seeing family members you do not live with, given masks, social distancing, and other guidelines are adhered to? My personal prediction would be that it is less risky than buying groceries, but I would trust evidence that can be defended much more than my gut, and it really bothers me that an organization which is supposed to represent the gold standard for dispensing evidence based guidance makes both of those statements above without offering compelling justification as to why they should both be true.

          What controls smell and taste? What causes Covid-19 to make someone lose these senses? I am assuming the lungs or brain in general do not control smell and taste (apart from recognition/identification). So, did those who have this side effect have it because all of their 'pores' on the surface of the tongue and nostrils were clogged with Covid or burned out by Covid? If Covid flew in fast and true beyond the nose and tongue I am guessing it might not cause the smell and taste side effect? Has anyone extensively interviewed (weeding out the psychosomatic suggestibles) Covid patients for specifics about which smells, which tastes, perfume food sweet salty sour fatty alchoholic etc?  Also, would scraping/brushing one's tongue at the time reduce the side effect?

          'IgM levels do wane earlier than IgG' according to the CDC website.  This might explain why my IgM was positive and my IgG was negative-my initial untested illness was almost a year ago. 
 When they run this antibody test, advertised as a Covid test, does that mean they specifically identified Covid-only antibodies, out of the soup of many other different infections that also might test positive for antibodies? I ask because I did not bother with healthcare at the time of my illness which could have been multiple different viruses besides Covid. 
 I am really noticing the long-term side effects of my infection from last March. Mental fog-unable to do math calculations I used to be able to do in my sleep lol, and a general fatigue, plus bizarre pounding pulse episodes, which only occur very sporadically without exertion and end quickly, while sitting in my recliner! Also momentary fevers/chills also very sporadically, and rather routine expulsions of green byproduct. I clearly have an ongoing infection of some kind-does Covid leave behind unhealed sores in areas not visible to us?

          My sibling and spouse recently tested positive for IgM and IgG antibodies. 
 They were minorly ill in November and experienced the classic loss of smell and taste.  They didn't see anyone at the time but when this cheap antibody test was offered 3 months later they were curious.  
 That made ME curious, lol. I believe I was exposed to Covid on 3/13/2020 (where our state's breakout began.) However... I was also in my sibling's presence face to face in November without masks. 
 Frankly, I eat and drink so much I am not sure I would notice loss of smell and taste...but I did have the other symptoms of Covid last March, and since. 
 So my IgM was positive but my IgG was negative. I realize each one could be a false result. 
 Barring that, what conclusions can I draw from each result? 
 Is there a test for the age of my antibodies? 
 Do antibodies have a shelf life after which you might test negative?
 What other viruses might this test have detected besides Covid? (I did have RSV-B 3 yrs ago.)

 excerpt from above article: 
 [Listerine Antiseptic is an alcohol‐based eucalyptol, menthol, methyl salicylate, and thymol formulation that historically has claimed numerous antimicrobial properties. It currently lists only a claim to kill germs that cause bad breath. Our tests show that it is highly effective at inactivating HCoV in solution (Table 3). Even at the lowest contact time of 30 s it inactivated greater than 99.99% of HCoV. Interestingly, other related products (Listerine Ultra, Equate Antiseptic, and CVS Antiseptic Mouth Wash), while showing substantial reductions, were not as efficient as Listerine Antiseptic (Table 3). These three products were unable to show a reduction of greater than 99.99% with 30‐s contact time. Equate required 2‐min contact time to show a greater 99.99% reduction.]
 I believe quite often medical research is the end result of general public questions, experiences, pressure, etc.  I would like to believe the medical sciences lead the pack, but have often seen otherwise. Example: the esteemed professional who said on national TV in the early days that we the public should not wear masks. 
 It is unwise to censor valuable public comment. We should merely be asked to disclaim any personal scientific certification. I am not certified (nor certifiable lol.) 
 I have strong common sense beliefs that airborn viruses take root primarily in the nasal passages first, and will then travel to your throat mouth lungs etc. 
 I believe in the efficacy of wiping your nostrils out after public exposure during viral outbreak seasons with tissues dabbed with regular Listerine.  I have been doing this during flu season for many years and have not had influenza for a decade. 
 I found a study (above.) The study has limitations. That study needs to be expanded to real research on covid-infected people. Have they done so yet?

          Hi all. This is just a general question. I keep seeing that there have been studies that people with Type O blood, may be protected against COVID, or have a lesser chance of contracting it. And if they do get it, it may be a less severe case. I also saw that RH negative blood, especially O negative, is showing potentially even more protection against COVID. 
Does anyone else know anything about this? Or have an opinion? 
I have O positive blood, and it just peaked my interest.

234,When did you turn positive after your exposure?,https://www.medhelp.org/posts/COVID19/When-did-you-turn-positive-after-your-exposure/show/3062092,2020-12-26T14:07:49-05:00,shouldiworry1323,"

          Hi everyone. I am on day 6 post exposure. My exposure was that I had my mom in the passenger seat of my car while I was driving for about an hour and a half on Sunday, the next day she began with symptoms, and Tuesday morning tested positive (her and my father) on a rapid test. My husband is an RN that is able to bring home rapid tests if and when needed.
I haven't had symptoms. Today I feel a little achy  but that could just be my kids tiring me out! I tested on Wednesday, day 3...rapid test negative. Then again this morning...rapid test...day 6..negative. I know it can be up to 2 weeks, but generally most people would show positive by now, right?
 Also, is riding in the car with an infected person the day before they had symptoms a big risk? With me driving and her in the passenger seat? Windows were up, due to it being winter.

          Hello Community,
 I have some confusion, my parents (no symptoms, they dont see no one and have left the house) since April. They decided to take a saliva test, the one that gets mailed home then dropped off to a location. When they got their results, my mom detected but my dad not detected. They got worried and 2 days later went to Kaiser per their Dr, to retest. They just got results and both negative. Has this happen to anyone? Also should I be worried for my folks? Thank you!

          So I've tested with a PCR swab test on hospital yesterday (26/12/20) and still waiting for the results to come out on tuesday (29/12/20). I decided to get tested because since Christmas eve i I've had a slight fever, a flu,a slight sore throat and apparently i can't smell anything up to this day, and my eyes kind of hurt(?) I don't really know how to explain this one. So to anticipate the result of the test being reactive, what should i do then? I didn't had any other symptoms other than this. Thank you guys

          The tech isn't there yet, but some companies are hoping by year end to be able to create 5 minute tests that are highly accurate. If successful, applications include things like a stadium or workplace employer being able to do 3,000 tests per hour with the results available within 5 minutes on the person's phone. I read about one city in NA today where only 1/3 of people called by the contact tracers of a health authority because of a potential exposure even bothered to answer the message they received.

          So back in June 1 tested positive pcr for covid. Had a headache and fever for three days and it got better. My wife was pregnant at the time so I wanted to confirm I was negative when I recovered. Finally after testing every week (was symptom free after day 3) received a negative pcr test 4 weeks from initial positive. 
Was symptom free and no issues at all. In August for a routine check up my primary tested me for antibodies which I had (expected). 
 Fast forward to a week ago a co worker tested positive and exposed me to covid. Exactly 6 months later. No issues went to the primary and again tested for antibodies and again positive for them. 2 days ago experienced headache and elevated temp (99.5) got tested. Positive on the antigen rapid test BUT negative on the PCR test. Again this is 5 days after exposure. Clinic says it was a false positive on the antigen test. 
 Still have headache and fever similar to the original symptoms I had. 
 Covid again or not ? I will test again with PCR

          Hello dear experts,
 I’d like to know why 
 a) they would take a coronavirus swab from both your nose and your throat? Isn’t the virus kind of everywhere in the liquids of your respiratory system?
 b) why is the nasal swab for coronavirus so deep? We’re supposed to keep the social distance of 1,5 m, which means that it should actually be more than enough to analyse a spit, a snot or just a swab from your tongue or from the beginning of your nostrils or at least just not that deep.
 Thanks

          Hi everyone,
 I need help understanding why i got a negative covid19 test while my gf got a positive (twice!). We  both live together, and we've been sleeping in the same bed, share food, kiss, intimacy, yet my results came back negative.
 Going back couple weeks (nov 3rd thru the 5th), I think i caught the cold from my gf. She started having runny nose and coughs. I caught the cold from her around the 4th i think, started getting coughs, runny nose and mild sore throat. It hit the hardest for me on the 5th. Had terrible cough (phlegm), bad headache, but next day it was better, and on Sunday i fully recovered.
 My gf had gone to a state where there was many known covid cases. She went from 6th, came back on  9th. Then started feeling COVID symptoms on the 11th. She had fatigue, loss and taste and smell, and mild coughs. She tested postive for COVID on Nov 18th. Nov 19th is when i started feeling something, mild body aches, then the 21th, i had sore throat, and a headache - That same day, i went to get tested with my gf testing again, but I came back NEGATIVE, while she retained her POSITIVE.
 Today, I seem fine, my sore throat is still there, but i can feel it getting better. But im curious as to why I got a negative? Do i have low viral load? I take multivitamins, which includes D and i also take Zinc 50mg daily.
 My gf is better now, she has a senses back completely as of today. We are going to get tested again tomorrow.
 Thank you for taking the time to read this.

          Oh, I know . . . always exceptions and everyone is different.  But this came across my news feed as what a study showed is the usual order of covid 19 symptoms.
 1. Fever
2. then cough develops
3. then muscle aches/joint pain
4. Then nausea and vomiting.
5. diarrhea is next.  (different from Sars which usually sees diarrhea before nausea).
  ""This order is especially important to know when we have overlapping cycles of illnesses like the flu that coincide with infections of COVID-19,"" said scientist Peter Kuhn, who worked alongside scientist James Hicks and doctoral candidate Joseph Larsen. ""Doctors can determine what steps to take to care for the patient, and they may prevent the patient's condition from worsening.""

          I was in a bad depression since before Covid hit, my medications have been adjusted and readjusted since January and are still being changed and adjusted. Nothing seems to be helping. I have no motivation to do things I normally would enjoy, I just play video games all day. Since Covid hit, my depression has only gotten worse. I am isolated in my home, alone, as I have a compromised immune system with diabetes, asthma and high blood pressure. When I do go out to get groceries I am hyperaware of everyone around me. Are they wearing a mask, are they wearing it properly, are they using their sleeve to cough into even though they are wearing a mask?  My anxiety is very high when I need to go out and I'm a nervous wreck by the time I get home. I just don't know how to dig myself out of this and it is getting worse as positive Covid numbers are rising every day, even more now than when it started.

          We know that health institutions worldwide have urged people to avoid mass gatherings, or really, gathering at all, during the current and upcoming holiday season.   I am hopeful that no one here is planning to ignore the warnings, but is anyone getting pressure to do so?
 I host Thanksgiving dinner every year, and invite all family and friends to join in.  This year, we're only having my parents over (they have been isolated, and so have we) for a few hours.  I feel a bit bad, because this means that some of my friends will spend Thanksgiving alone, or alone as a couple, but I've been extremely honest about our reasons: ""We would love to have you  join us, but we're playing it safe, and helping stop the spread.  Hopefully, we can celebrate together next year.""  I still feel somewhat guilty.

 if you touched other surfaces like my car steering ..etc .. does the viral load get reduced .. assuming there is virus in the first place ..

          Recently I stayed at a hotel for work purposes. The cleanliness was okay as far as I could tell but reviews are mixed on typical review sites, some stating clean, others not. I had no cleaning products so I used hand sanitizer with my own clean cloth to clean the only table which I placed my laptop/phone and keys on to do do some work. Even after I used the faucet handles, I sanitized my hands. I cannot recall touching my face, mouth or nose. COVID19 is relatively low in my area of the country (NJ/PA) and my anxiety got the better of me that I actually left after 2-3 hours of my stay and drove home. Normal check in time is 4PM and checkout time is 11AM. So quite a bit of time even if the last person had left any respiratory droplets on said table. The room was also rather hot when I entered. I'm probably reaching but do I have much to be concerned about? I always wear my mask in public and keep 6ft distance whenever I'm around anybody not wearing a mask.

          Sorry -- this may sound like paranoia. I live in an apartment building and as I was turning a corner inside the building, someone coming from the opposite side of the corner I was turning literally bumped into me for a second. He had no mask on, while I had a mask and glasses on. This was literally a 1-2 second ""interaction"" as we essentially bumped into each other, but kept moving. I assume this is very low risk, but just seeing what anyone else may think. The area where I am at now was the epicenter of the pandemic when it began, but of course is doing much, much better now. Just concerns me this guy had no mask on (I think he said ""sorry"" as we walked past each other), and by bumping into me, we clearly weren't 6 feet apart (and this was inside the building). But this was as brief of an exposure as you can get and I did have a mask on, although he did not. Thoughts?

          I read online several times that coronavirus is 'airborne' which i definitely believe it is, but can it really live in the air for a long time even after the person has left the room? I read that it can survive in the air for 3 hours, but in that experiment, i believe they were using fans to blow it and keep it in the air, but im not sure. Meanwhile other sources i read told me it only stays airborne for 14 minutes.
 Say for example, a girl named Marsha has coronavirus and her roommate, Jan, stays in her own bedroom. Marsha walks through the hallway and breaths in the hallway right outside of Jan's bedroom, then Marsha leaves and goes somewhere else. 2 hours later, Jan walks out of her bedroom and breaths the same air and walks though it, can Jan get coronavirus?
 Is something like that actually possible?

          Hello,
I have a question for medical professionals. My wife and I need marriage counseling. It will probably be more effective face to face. We have a three year old and a six year old. If we’re going to leave the house, we need a babysitter. 
 I am a middle school choir teacher and start teaching in person 4 days a week very soon. Even though I will be wearing a mask and my students will, I feel like this means my family poses a higher risk of infection to anyone we ask for help. Since we are most likely to have an evening appointment, that means the girls will need to be fed or put to bed. Social distancing is unlikely. 
 I need to know that if a friend or family member is helping us out, we are not putting them at risk of infection, especially if the people who help are my 68 year old parents. 
 Does anyone have advice on PPE and strategies we can use to keep our babysitters safe? Also, please list your credentials when answering my questions and thank you for your help.

My school is going back to in-person learning on August 24th. Sports are starting up on the 17th. How risky is it for me to go back? It seems from all my research that only moderate to severe asthma puts you at a higher risk of serious complications. Thank you!

          I'm pretty nervous about coronavirus COVID-19. Every time you turn on the TV or get on the internet, there's some new information about the virus, or how far it's spread.
 I'm trying to prepare as best I can, like making sure I use hand sanitizer and having plenty stocked up. 
 I'm not sure if I'm at risk or not, since I'm young and relatively healthy, and I don't even know if anything I'm doing will help me from getting sick. 
 How do you wade through ALL of this information and know what to do to prevent getting it, and what to do if there's an outbreak near you?

          I may have been exposed to Covid on March 13. (Tour bus to and from a casino near a community with an outbreak related to travelers returning home from an Egyptian cruise. I left home at 9am back home by 7pm.) 
 That night, I experienced a sudden dry barking chain of 6 coughs in about 1 minute (it felt like a flea had bit the back of my throat, just beyond the uvula) which was immediately followed by sudden onset flood of fluid from my sinuses down the back of my throat which was immediately followed by a separate flood of saliva into my mouth which triggered an overwhelming desire to throw up. I was retching and spitting but staved off throwing up. (zinc lozenge and mouthwash to trick the urge.) I then cycled between chills and feverish for 3 days. After 3 days I was fine... but I did experience a few days of skyrocketed blood pressure weeks later with tight pulsating base of neck and sharp stabs of pain under left lower rib cage. Today I feel great.
 Feverish was 98.2 and MY normals run mid 96 to mid 97. (Couple yrs ago recovering from RSV I bottomed out in the mid 95's.) 
 My average body temp is always below what guidelines declare is normal. If I am feverish but below temp guidelines am I contagious to anyone whose body temp is higher than mine?

          For the past three weeks my partner and I have been showing very similar symptoms including full-body aches, nausea, and chills. However, these symptoms tend to flare up for both us on the same days and - in one case - down to almost the same time. 
 Day 1: Three weeks ago my partner (who I live with) woke up with chills, full-body aching, and was having a hard time breathing - the latter of which lasted about 3 hours before improving. Concerned this was COVID and since she has a slightly compromised immune system, we went to the ER. She was ultimately cleared to go home and her tests came back negative. That same morning, I also woke up feeling terrible. I had full body aches and chills, as well as nausea, but had no breathing issues. Assuming it was something I ate and just coincidental timing with my partner's symptoms, I did not get tested for COVID. My partner had been showing some lighter symptoms w/out breathing issues a few days prior. I had shown no prior symptoms. Both my partner and I felt ill from around 6am until 2/3pm. The transition from feeling ill to feeling better was really quick. My partner went back to just mild symptoms and I was nearly 100% better. (We quarantined for 14 days out of an abundance of caution.)
 Day 2: Six days after day 1, we woke up with the exact same symptoms we had individually experienced on day 1: partner had trouble breathing, I had nausea, and we both had full body aches and chills. These symptoms lasted maybe 5-6 hours this time. Again, once they were over, they were over. We were back to feeling normal by that evening.
 Day 3: Just yesterday (just over 3 weeks since day 1 and about 2.5 weeks since day 2) we both started feeling ill again after a couple weeks of feeling fine. This time, our symptoms started at around 6:30pm and they lasted about 3 hours. The freaky part was that our symptoms flared up almost down to the minute and came on like a light switch. Within 20 minutes or so we both went from feeling fine to feeling chills, aches, nausea, and partner had tightness of chest again.
 We are both mid-twenties, generally healthy, get consistent exercise, etc. Outside of partner's immune system (IgA deficiency) we have no other underlying conditions. Between our symptom flare ups, we have felt generally well. Is this COVID and the test just came back false negative, or something else? And why we are experiencing symptoms at nearly the same times?

And this virus is making me go nuts and making me think beyond. I am losing my mind so I was wondering do babies have high chance of getting the virus if they are not breastfed.

          I have this weird feeling in my throat. When I swallow my saliva hard, I feel like a lump. But there is nothing around my neck when I touch it. I gargle here and that and it gets better but then comes back again. I also been getting wisdom tooth for years, and it never comes out fully. Always stuck in between and I do get some pain cause of that.
 I been having sore throat and some dry cough. So I was wondering if all these symptoms are of covid 19 or could it be anything else. It been over a week, my symptoms did not get worse but still the same. I have no runny nose or watery eyes or fever.

          Hello, 
I was washing produce that was brought from the grocery (I used soap and water) and as I was foaming up a piece of fruit, some of the soap and water splashed my face. My wife looks at me with this horrified look on her face, I think she's being silly, but she mentions that's how this can spread. Now, I try to be the level headed one and mention that 1 the virus would have been washed away by now and 2 it doesn't travel/survive on food (from what I've read). However, as time passes, I find my mind spiraling out of control about the possibility that it could be true. Is it possible that she may be right?

          Would hyperbarics chambers oxygenize in a different way than ventilators, or is it the same thing? I declined admission 2yrs back when I had RSV (b) even though I felt a bit desperate for oxygen (and really sucked it down in the ER.) I was at 85% and left at 95%. I was surprised they don't send you home with prescribed oxygen. (Been wondering about those little canisters of oxygen they sell in catalogs, and those oxygen bars lol.) At the time, as my lungs filled, I kept fantasizing about the dental hygienist's suction tool!

          I broke my nose years back and have a deviated septum and possibly some other structural differences in my nose.  After the test I noticed that they put the swab in through the nostril that I have trouble breathing through. Could this affect whether the swab can be inserted far enough back to get enough of a sample for the test?

301,Use of copper and UV light to defeat Coronavirus,https://www.medhelp.org/posts/COVID19/Use-of-copper-and-UV-light-to-defeat-Coronavirus/show/3055430,2020-05-11T07:39:24-04:00,keveen21,"

          Copper kills bacteria and viruses in minutes and even Coronavirus cannot survive for long.
 "" The process involves the release of copper ions (electrically charged particles) when microbes, transferred by touching, sneezing or vomiting, land on the copper surface. The ions prevent cell respiration, punch holes in the bacterial cell membrane or disrupt the viral coat, and destroy the DNA and RNA inside.""
 1. Why is Copper not used more in hospitals on door handles, toilet facilities etc?
 Ultra violet light at certain frequencies kills viruses. They do use it in some hospitals to steralise rooms and equipment but it is hazardous for humans. However there is now a new frequency identified that is not harmful.
 "" far-UVC light (207-222 nm) efficiently inactivates bacteria without harm to exposed mammalian skin. This is because, due to its strong absorbance in biological materials, far-UVC light cannot penetrate even the outer (non living) layers of human skin or eye; however, because bacteria and viruses are of micrometer or smaller dimensions, far-UVC can penetrate and inactivate them. ""
 2. Why are hospitals not using this virus killing light in ICU setting and what about this new safe form of UV light?
 (Could be used on school equipment too)

          I live in a 55+ condo community. We had our association meeting last night. Ages 63-95. 5 people at  table 1, not distanced, 1 with mask, 2 w/masks in hand, 2 without masks. 3 people at table 2, 1 distanced but no mask, 2 not distanced (married) but w/masks. I then sat at table 3, distanced, with mask. The first thing is that the two speakers (board members) at table 1 waved the masks in their hands (one of them has high volume public contact daily) and said they were not going to wear them unless anyone objected.  Another board member with mask then removed her mask in generational conformity, leaving 5 without mask and not distanced at table 1. The woman without mask at table 2 has a hearing disability and then walked over to table 1 and spoke to two of the ladies ~6inches face to face to repeat loudly (droplets...) what was under discussion. 
 I have been wearing masks when flu season starts, for many years. I will never forget Dr Fauci standing in front of America and saying ""Don't wear a mask.""  (I understand what he was trying to say don't wear MEDICAL-GRADE masks because healthcare providers need them. They need to read from proof-read scripts only, imo.) 
 So the local farm supply store is selling pkgs of 5 K N95 masks for ~$20 and there were a hundred packages, 2 companies, made in China. Nice masks. Mom and I bought a package to share and the spares will come in handy this coming flu season. 
 So is K N95 the same as N95??

          As everyone probably knows, they've been testing Remdesivir, developed originally to fight ebola. Today Dr. Fauci announced that they were going to stop testing with a placebo group vs. a group that gets the drug, because it was clear the drug helps. He said that the median recovery time for patients taking the drug was 11 days, compared with 15 days in the placebo group. There was a mortality rate of 8% for the group receiving Remdesivir versus 11.6% for the placebo group
 Gilead, the lab that developed Remdesivir, simply announced that in their own testing, 50% of people getting a five-day dose of Remdesivir saw improvement. 
 Dr. Fauci compared this to when the first drugs were found to be helpful in the fight against AIDS. No one drug immediately solved the problem, but the first one that helped was encouraging.
 Who was really encouraged was the stock market! (And me, who had been thinking getting Covid-19 would doom me to having a stroke or heart damage or just be an automatic death sentence.) Anyway, the market bounded upward at the news, though Gilead's stock, while it did go up, didn't go as crazy as one might expect. (Maybe the analysts read the news as ""only"" 50% of people improved). But the market on the whole clearly thought the glass was half full, not half empty. lol

          I understand that there are 2 line of though on febrile response. 1. fever is part of the disease and should  be suppressed at al costs to make the person feel better, 2. fever is the immune systems response to a viral, bacterial or parasitical infection. 
 f course that is oversimplifying the mechanics of it all. Personally I have found that my family, ( kids of 9 and 10 and wife aged 47) have always recovered quick from viral infections if we let the fever run it's course without intervention. Recently we have all recovered from Covid, with myself still dealing with the lack of smell and taste . . My kids have had temperatures of upto 41 when they had chicken pox and cognitively they have no issues. So why if Covid virus replication slows down at over 38 degrees does the standard advice include anti pyretics.I mean surely that would lead to a worse outcome

          Dear Community.  I know it's prob. a slightly controversial question, but I'm not asking it because of that.  It's just as this comes from bats, surely the reason bats don't die from it is because they never social-distanced(!) just kept right on mixing and all those that survived became immune.  As we've BEEN social distancing, and say we're going BACK to social distancing should cases increase, wouldn't that make herd immunity take a LOT longer to build up? Shouldn't we just bite the bullet, remember how small a percentage actually die from the disease (the reason the UK Govt. DOWNGRADED it on March 20th - they don't tell you that in the news!) and let the cases spread a bit to build up immunity?

          What does the future hold? 
Mutations are a natural part of the virus life cycle, this virus is also going to mutate. If and when the vaccine is out, maybe the virus could adapt to it and develop resistance.
 E.g. Researchers in Brazil traced the virus, they isolated SARS-CoV-2 from two patients confirmed to have COVID-19. They sequenced the complete genomes of both samples of the virus, not only did they find that genomes differ from each other but also they were totally different from the genomes of the virus samples sequenced in Wuhan, China.
 Based on a recent chinese research, Coronavirus has already mutated into two strains the ""S"" type and the ""L"" type, the former one being the aggressive type that was found responsible for 70% of the total infection. 
 There are greater minds at work to find a vaccine to this virus. However, any such treats and advancements can be discussed here on this thread.

After unpacking everything and washing up; maybe about an hour or so after, we were fitting all the grocery packaging and grocery bags into one big trash bag to be disregarded and put out of sight. As I was stuffing the last small bag (containing other items) into the larger one, the lack of room and my attempting to stuff everything to create room resulted in a plume of air pushing out from the garbage directly onto my face (was not wearing a mask at this point). 
 I'm now wondering whether if there was contamination on the items that were in the bag, if the forcing of air out of the bag could in a sense pull the virus off the surface of the items and in into the escaping air, hypothetically resulting in an aerosolized issue for my face. It wasn't like I was breathed on from another person, but could it be possible that, hypothetically, the virus could have been released from the surfaces of the thrown away packaging by way of the air plume? I know there are a lot of unknowns right now and I had read about aerosol issues, so hoping this realistically wouldn't be one as I am definitely in a hot spot now. Thanks.

          The covid-19 experience mainly has been stressful, and scary. However, through managing a team of 8 and trying to stay focus on positive things and good vibes. I know some good has come from it as well.
 A co-worker of mine who worked two jobs and now is working from home finally got to catch up with her teen daughters and realized how much they are growing up.
 For me what keeps me going is trusting that this will one day get better. Using my lunch to spend time with my pups, catch up on household chores, and the lunch that i sometime get with my husband.
 What have you had positive come from this? Do you know a positive story?

          Washington Examiner article excerpts below suggesting only 70% sensitivity. They don't mention specificity %. https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/health-experts-believe-1-in-3-infected-patients-getting-negative-coronavirus-test-results
Health experts think upward of 30 per cent of patients infected with the coronavirus are receiving negative test results.
 “The whole testing field is in flux,” Bill Miller, a physician and epidemiologist at the Ohio State University, told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday. “The thing that is different this time is most of these tests are going through a really rapid validation process. As a result, we can’t be completely confident in how they will perform.”
 Mike Lozano, a Florida-based executive for Envision Healthcare Corp., said that he believes the currently available coronavirus tests are likely only accurate about 70 per cent of the time.

    Second act: Former CEO of RadioShack now an ER doctor on frontlines of COVID-19 fight
 Chris Smalley, a Kentucky-based doctor, said the 70 per cent estimate is becoming a popular guess by doctors as to how accurate the coronavirus tests are. He added that he has seen several patients test negative while still showing symptoms of the coronavirus and needing extended hospital stays.
 “A false negative is problematic because it tells the patient they don’t have the virus,” Craig Deligdish, a Florida oncologist, said.

          In the past I’ve had chest tightness that came anytime the seasons switched. I live in GA so that’s pretty much once or twice a year. In the past week after eating out it’s become unbearable nothing like the mild ones I experienced before  where I went to the my primary care immediately but my chest X-ray was negative for anything as well as EKG. I also just went to the ER and received  a breathing treatment which helped but didn’t completely solve my problem. I don’t have a fever, rarely cough, and haven’t been out of the country. The chest tightness/pain has been my only symptoms. I do have some intestinal discomfort but I attribute that to an earlier condition from last October. I am at high risk for infections due to asthma as a child and bronchitis as a teenager.

          Doctors in Iran, Britain, Italy and China reported that many patients without respiratory symptoms lost their sense of smell then taste. Cooks with Covid can't identify the foods in their dishes or taste them and a mother couldn't smell her baby's diaper mess. 
Article also mentions this note about ENT doctors .............who advised against performing nonessential sinus endoscopy procedures on anyone, because the virus replicates in the nose and the throat and an exam can prompt coughs or sneezes that expose the doctor to a high level of virus.
 Two ear, nose and throat specialists in Britain who have been infected with the coronavirus are in critical condition, Dr. Hopkins said.

          Hello,
I have mild-moderate mitral regurgitation (see enclosed description). I am 53yo, the situation is non-rheumatic, stable (due to a slender valve shape), my situation is stable I am otherwise healthy and fit.
 I read online that ""Patients who have heart valve abnormalities that are well compensated and well-tolerated at baseline, are more susceptible to heart failure if they were to become infected with coronavirus. Because of the underlying heart valve issues, if damage to the pumping chamber of the heart were to occur, patients would be less able to tolerate that.""
 Am I at greater risk of developing severe illness should I be infected? (Should I take greater than usual precautions so as not to get infected?)
 I would really appreciate any answer you could provide. 
Thank you!

          So in layman's terms, who is high risk?
 Are people of a certain age automatically high risk, even if we're healthy? My kids are all over me to stay inside because I'm in my 70s, but I'm healthy. 
 If I don't have diabetes, heart disease or lung issues, do I have to stay inside? Can't I go to dinner at my friends' houses?

          I've been under the impression that coughing spreads the virus to others through breathing it in. Lately I've been confused by certain health authorities statements since they conflict with that idea. 
Today I read this statement from the head of a Health Authority governing 930,000 people in North America. ""Carr reiterated that the good news about COVID-19 is that it's not airborne and is transmitted by personal contact. But that's why he said being strict about social distancing and self-isolation is so important.""
 I presume what he means is if someone coughs the droplets can only infect a surface that is 6 feet away (including your face and air passageway) that you might touch later and end up infected. So inhaling them within 6 feet of the cougher can infect you, otherwise you are safe if farther away. Or does someone else know the answer? If so a direct quote and a link would be appreciated.

          More of a fun question than anything else.  I find going to the grocery to be daunting right now, they are packed.  Delivery and curb side pick up at grocery stores is now well over a week out.  Some things are just gone right now.  Having any trouble with this?  What do you wish you had more of when you are in your houses??

          Anyone who reads a lot of articles about Covid quickly discovers that age 60 is the average age people have got it, and that underlying conditions and age are the primary reasons people die. The average fatality rate is 80.
However this article about Iran claims ""Zali also acknowledged ""many"" of those who have died from COVID-19 were otherwise healthy, a rare admission by local authorities that the virus does not only prey on the sick and elderly."" 
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/iran-reports-113-virus-deaths-containment-concerns-mount-200315180552632.html
Iran's government has not been trustworthy and there isn't any external review of their claims, fwiw. 7 different studies a week ago estimated an average of 2M infected Iranians, but the government spokespeople numbers are much lower.

          I had a septic blood disease 5 years ago which caused spots on my lung and my brain. I was hospitalized for 32 days over the course of three months. Typically IV antibiotics would cure this within six weeks but it took 24 weeks of hardcore IV antibiotics through a PICC line. Does this make my immune system more susceptible to catching the coronavirus at this time? I am a diabetic and it is completely under control now but since I was on such high steroids throughout my infection my retinas were completely destroyed and I am legally blind now. I don't leave the house very often.

          The title of this week old article from healthing.ca is ""'We don't have to worry about our kids dying': Immunologist"". 
 As the world watches COVID-19 take hold in our communities, there’s one trend that has caught the curiosity of researchers: why are kids not responding the same way to the virus as adults?
While it was originally believed that children were immune to the virus, there are now cases involving children — at least one in Alberta, and 17 in Ontario, including one involving a baby boy.
Dawn Bowdish, the Canada Research Chair in Aging and Immunity, says that we now know children are infected at the same rate as adults, but that they don’t necessarily show the symptoms.
“When they do show the symptoms, they’re very mild compared to adult symptoms,” she says. “This shows us that the virus can get into kids’ bodies, they just don’t get very sick.”
Older adults and those with pre-existing health conditions seem to be the most at risk compared to children.
One study in JAMA found that reported cases in children were ‘rare’ as the average age for coronavirus patients was between 49 to 56 years old. Another study from the New England Journal of Medicine examined 425 patients, finding that no one under the age of 15 had the virus. The WHO has reported that 2.4 per cent of cases were children under the age of 18, while only 0.2 per cent of cases were cases where children were seriously ill.
“We don’t have to worry about our children dying,” says Bowdish. However, she acknowledges that the virus’ death rates vary from country to country, and vulnerable populations are the most at risk everywhere, including in Canada.
“Right now, children aren’t going to be the ones filling up our emergency rooms, it’s going to be older adults.” she says.
Of course, if you suspect your child is sick, it’s a good idea to get them tested just in case.
Currently, health experts don’t understand whether children can transmit the virus in the same way that they can transmit influenza in a community outbreak — meaning spreading it to parents, grandparents, classmates, etc. In influenza outbreaks, taking measures such as shutting down schools or vaccinating against the illness can break the transmission of the virus, benefitting the whole community. In the case of COVID-19, we just don’t know the role that kids play in its spread.
    Health experts don’t understand whether children can transmit the virus the same way they can transmit influenza
With March Break approaching Bowdish says it could cause the infection to spread, as many families head out on vacation to the U.S. and international destinations. The Ontario government recently announced the closure of all publicly funded schools in Ontario for two weeks following March break, in response to the growing number of cases of COVID-19. It’s a move that she says is “excellent.”
“Families [who may get infected] will come back from their March Break holiday and have two weeks before the kids end up back at school. Hopefully, that will be sufficient to slow down transmission,” she says. Bowdish adds that the earlier we take these measures to reduce the spread of infection before the health care system is overburdened, the better chance it has to help.
While closing the schools will definitely help to prevention infection, Bowdish says there is another way — one that is harder than the other. Staying away from grandparents.
“Grandparents are everyone’s defacto babysitter,” she says. “This is problematic because this virus infects older adults and causes them to become severely ill.” She suggests that parents find alternative childcare if they can.
Another prevention strategy is teaching children how to properly wash their hands. Not only does educating kids on how they can protect themselves empower them and make them feel like they have a little bit of control in such an uncertain time, it also teaches them that they also have a role to play in keeping other people safe.
    Families [who may get infected] will come back from their March Break holiday and have two weeks before the kids end up back at school. Hopefully, that will slow down transmission
Bowdish says these measures are important, as they help adults and children take care of themselves. While the virus may seem like a regular flu, it’s important for parents, and children to step up and take precautions whenever they can.
“Anytime we have a bad flu year or an epidemic, [these] cause mortality and our hospitals become strained,” she says. “That’s one of the consequences we’re going to see here. We need to break the transmission of the virus.”

After my initial positive covid home test I contacted my dr and was prescribed paxlovid all was well at first and I started getting better within a couple of days and tested negative about the third day of taking it. I continued to feel better until a few days after finishing the 5th day of paxlovid. Then I started feeling ill again with even worse symptoms including a mild fever  for several days and sinus infection symptoms. I am right now at almost 3 weeks from my first onset of COVID and close to one week into the rebound and still COVID positive.  So if I were to do it over I would probably NOT take paxlovid and maybe my immune system would have killed it the first time and I may not have had to go through it again. So just wondering if anyone else has gone through this and how long did it take to fully recover ?

My sense of taste was not affected. After a few weeks it started to come back and all seemed fine. Then a couple of weeks ago just after the new year when eating a mint I noticed a very odd chemical taste. Everything else tasted fine. Then a little over a week ago I opened up a peanut butter jar and it smelled horrible. Smelled just like that chemical taste of the mint but 100x worse. Now last week many things have a faint chemical smell. I thought it might be a new detergent or something but my wife swears nothing has changed. It is faint and if I did not suffer from GAD then I probably wouldn't notice it.

The best I have been able to figure out is in very late December I was using some paint stripper, which seems to be very close to the chemical smell, and that somehow my nose wires got crossed. I was in a pretty well ventilated area. When I am outside I do not smell this at all. When I come back in I swear I can smell chemicals but NO ONE else in the house can smell anything.

I do not believe this to be a neurological issue as in late October I had an MRI for other reasons and nothing was discovered. 

Have any other people post COVID had issues smelling and tasting chemicals or other odd tastes/smells? If so what did you do to help the issue?

Thanks!"

I got covid during that time because I was travelling in a public transport inspite of wearing mask (cloth) and washing hands. I was also not eligible for vaccines. Now I am double vaxxed (got 2nd dose in Nov 10) waiting for booster.

My symptoms were severe as I had 12 day fever, lung tightness and very low appetite. Many times my oximeter readings started from 91, 92 or 93 but settles at 94 or 95. 

I am fed up with precautions. I have to go to college and board public transport. N95 masks are expensive and cannot be reused. Cloth masks don't protect but it is affordable and cheap. I don't want to get seriously ill from covid.

I want to know more efficient precautions against covid-19. "

                            ","Like many others, I have had Covid three times now. The first time was in Jan 2021 and it lasted a month. I lost the sense of smell and taste for almost a month, couldn't breathe through my nose for over a week and stayed moderately congested for 2 additional weeks, had consistent fevers, chills, headaches and coughing for six days straight, couldn't eat for a week (my stomach hurt so badly, but I couldn't keep anything down and was too nauseous to try to eat), had a persistent sore throat for a week, and was dehydrated. However, the worst symptom was severe shoulder pain. I mean intense, felt like I was on fire, shoulder pain in both shoulders. My partner attempted to massage them for me once, but the slightest touch put me in tears. They burned so badly! The intensity lasted about 4 days, and slowly departed over the course of 2 weeks. I did go to the ER in the beginning (around day 2) because I couldnt breathe well and the shoulder pain was intense, but they said my O2 levels were good, my lungs were clear, and to go home and get rest. They prescribed Tessalon Pearls and Amoxicillin, and said to take OTC pain relievers for the shoulder pain.  

Thereafter, I received 2 Moderna vaccinations, wore masks every day, used sanitizer and washed my hands regularly, and didn't go in public other than to pick up my grocery orders to avoid going in public places- it was work and home. Despite those efforts, in Dec 2021, I got Covid again. That time around it was more like the flu. I did experience body aches that time, but it was mild and not general to one location. I did not get the boosters because I developed myocarditis after the 2 Moderna vaccinations and it was recommended by my doctor to wait until more findings come out to avoid more stress on my heart in case I developed the condition again with the boosters. After a week of Covid #2, I was fine. 

Despite the regulations lifting thereafter, I maintained wearing the masks daily, limited my outings to parks, trails, and remote locations with my kids despite my family and friends unwavering pleas to go out (they think Im paranoid), still picked up grocery orders, continued to wash my hands and use sanitizer regularly, etc., and as of this Friday, I have developed Covid again. I have a constant sore throat, persistent fevers/chills/headaches, nausea/vomiting/diarrhea (sorry), difficulty sleeping, severe fatigue (but cant sleep!!!), and body aches. The shoulder pain is back and I am on day 3 as I type this. It is not as intense as the first time, but it is moderate, and the doctor I saw couldnt explain it or diagnose the issue. They offered pain meds, but I wont take them. I want to treat the cause, not the symptom. I cant find much online about it and the closest thing I can find is related to shoulder neuropathy (Im not even sure if that is the correct terminology). I am wondering if anyone else has experienced this, and if so, what are your doctors saying about the condition? My only medical condition prior to any of this is hypothyroidism which runs in my family, and yes, unfortunately, I am a smoker.

Does anyone have any information on this symptom? Is it common? Will it go away? Are there studies that it could be longer lasting or damaging in the long run? I can't find too much on it and I know studies are still ongoing as Covid is new for us all, but the shoulder pain at times is intense. It truly feels like they are on fire- a burning sensation from the inside out. Hot to the touch, can't touch the shoulders at times as the pain gets intense, and Aleve, Tylenol, and ice/hot packs are ineffective. Im just drained and afraid of what is to come as reports coming out are now stating increased risks to health each time we get the virus, and it seems no matter the precautions taken, reinfection is inevitable- at least for me.  Any information anyone can share or provide would be greatly appreciated! The doctors here wont run tests on it, and while this bout is not as bad as the first time, the pain at times is unbearable.

                            ","Hi,

I've had Covid19  for 4 weeks and if I had the energy I'd be tearing my hair out.
I've had 2 sets of prohylactic antibiotics to safeguard against bacterial infections, my temperature has been up and down but never higher than 38 the entire illness.
I've had severe neuropathy during the illness and some kind of night seizures accompanying the other more well publicised symptoms that mean my sleep is terrible also.

I went to hospital Day 14  after a week of seriously thinking I'm on death's door and my blood oxygen was good enough to be sent home for follow up at the Covid Hubs where they basically just take temperature, pulse and oxygen levels.
I was prescribed a 2nd course of antibiotics there as my temperature was still up and they are checking in on me every few days.

Meanwhile I am having one better day, then another terrible day, then a better day then a worse day..But 'better' is still bed ridden, just means I can breath well enough and not too dizzy to make myself my own cup of tea, have a shower and engage in some small talk with my family. 
Everytime I have a good few hours I think, that must be me getting well now, but no, 4 weeks later and the last 24 hrs my breathlessness has been worse than it was for the previous 5 days..Am about ready to shoot myself.
Is there anyone else that's experienced being so ill with this virus outside of an ICU setting where it's carried on this long?
Even ICU patients are recovering in 3-6weeks .
Cannot understand why I'm not getting well yet.
I have no underlying health issues and I'm in my 30s. 
I don't know if I still have Covid or if this is post viral inflammation and fatigue..There is no way of knowing as they are not testing community cases. Every doctor just says it's definitely Covid but I have no idea if I've passed the peak of the illness or if i should still be worried it could get worse. 
Just feel it's going on forever.
Be great to know if there's any non hospital stories of people being sick, as in still unable to do a thing this length of time. 
Thanks! "

I'm wondering if anyone's had similar experience.

This is the third time I've fallen ill with Covid .( within 9 monts)
I have 2 vaccinations( Phizer, the most recent one received Sep 21)
The first time I got infected was February this year while being on holiday in Tenerife. I was actually climbing mount Teide ( over 3000m) ,and i was feeling quite out of breath but i was sure it is just reaction to high altitude. When i came back to the UK i developed fatigue and headaches.Covid test was positive. Same for my husband. Symptoms weren't too bad and i continued working ( from home)
In May we travelled to Peru and Chile. whilst being in Cusco( altitude 3400) i started to feel very light headed and out of breath. I was taken to the hospital and was diagnosed with altitude sickness, given oxygen and medicine.But didn't get much better. Covid test at rhat point was negative .Arrived in Chile and immediately fell ill with a cold .I had fever,cough, headaches and positive Covid. Once i recovered from that i got a stomach issues .I couldn't eat anything, felt nauseous, fatigued .Have not been feeling very well since then.Last week we went to Ireland to friend's wedding and decided to extend this trip to do some climbing which we love. Straight after the wedding i had noticed a little bit itchy throat which i blamed on AC , I had covid twice this year so didn't even consider it. And it wasn't anything big. so we climbed the highest mountain in Ireland( only over 1000m) Then it started to get worse.Developed sore throat, difficulty breathing, extreme fatigue ,runny nose and couldn't sleep .Once back home, did the Covid test which came back positive. This time i can't work or do any simple tasks.Even walking to the toilet is difficult. 
My husband had negative test.
I'm 35 years old female. I'm not overweight ( I'm slightly underweight).
suffer from mild asthma,dust allergy. I do have anxiety and OCD also suffer from insomnia.
I have done some health checks and tests after the second COVID and they all came back ok.
But i feel that I'm getting weaker and keep catching viruses recently
Before Covid i have never had any viruses,colds or anything like it .
I understand that this is not a doctor's office, but maybe someone has had a similar experience?
thanks"

I was diagnosed with Covid in mid-August 2021. Overall, I had a fairly easy go of it. It took me a little over 3 weeks to test negative ( I only know this because my place of employment required me to submit a negative test to return to work). Anyway, while I was positive with the virus, my main symptoms were coughing fits, low-grade fever, fatigue, and feelings of anxiety.

Fast forward to now, I'm feeling absolutely horrible. I've had a headache around my left eyebrow/temple area every single day for over a month.  Sometimes it's minor and passes quickly, sometimes it's very debilitating and I'm bedridden with a pulsating headache for hours/days. But not a day has gone by where I haven't felt some pressure in my head. Also, occasionally I feel ""twitching"" in my legs, hands and fingers. Feels almost like I'm going to have an anxiety attack. 

If it's not a headache or twitching/anxiety bringing me down, it's extreme fatigue. My appetite is also random. Some days I'm not hungry at all and don't eat all day, other days I'm insatiable and can't stop eating. But I haven't had a 100% good day in months. 

Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, what are you doing to help alleviate these symptoms? I started taking magnesium oxide supplements for the headaches yesterday, hoping that takes effect soon. I also started drinking ginger tea a few days ago which seems to be helping with the anxiousness. Other than that, I spend most of my time laying in bed trying to relax and hoping I feel better... It's not fun.

By way of background, I am a 28 year old male who contracted Covid back in October, along with my parents who are in their 60s. Thankfully all of our symptoms were mild similar to a seasonal cold and all recovered within around 10 days.

Over the last few days, I have been experiencing acute chest pains in my left side where my heart is. This has come on all of a sudden, prior to covid and even during and after being infected I never experienced this. 

The best way I can describe it is a feeling of sudden tension and throbbing around the heart, along with stabbing pains and some shooting pains in my left arm. I have booked a GP appointment as obviously this is slightly alarming, however I wanted to see if anyone else has experienced similar?

My dad who is in his 60s was affected with the exact same problem as myself, albeit a few weeks before.

I'm otherwise fit and healthy and to all intents and purposes this seems to have come out of nowhere. 

I'm curious to find out if anyone else has had similar experiences and would welcome feedback from your experiences.

I have been told by NHS consultants that chest pain and heart complications are some of the symptoms that have been identified post Covid, however there's not enough data available so it would be great to hear other people's experiences to hopefully generate a wider evidence base moving forward.

Thanks for reading and keep on moving forward!"

                            ","I’ve had COVID symptoms since August 10th with sinus congestion, chills and a fever.  The fever went away in almost a week.  Around August 18th I started getting shortness of breath, cough and pain in the chest.  I went back to the doctor the end of August due to continued shortness of breath, lots of congestion and chest pain.  A chest X-ray was taken at that time, and I had Covid Pneumonia.  An EKG was performed and blood work was taken.  The EKG was normal and my blood work was normal.  The doctor advised me to do saline nasal rinses, take ibuprofen for pain, and monitor my oxygen with a pulse oximeter. 

I had a follow up doctor’s appointment a week ago.  I was prescribed antibiotics for my sinuses and they took another chest x-ray.  The antibiotics have helped clear up my sinus congestion.   The X-Ray showed no signs of Covid Pneumonia, but I still have a feeling of suffocation or a lump in my throat, chest pain, and I can barely sleep.  

I’m now 6 weeks out and have lots of anxiety.  If you have experienced long term issues, could you share your experience?  What has helped? Timeline of recovery?

It's currently 5am on day 3, and the fever has been raging on, constantly. I've been taking at least 3 antipyretics a day because it's unbearable and it makes me extremely miserable, plus the weather here is already very hot. I've been alternating between ibuprofen and soluble paracetamol. Paracetamol works faster but seems to last a little bit less, it also contains a lot of sodium from what i know, ibuprofen takes forever to work (at least 40-50 minutes) but it seemed to last a bit longer, but I've also read it can be hard on the kidneys. I managed to fall asleep through the fever last night (which always peaks at 38.8-39.2), I've been taking my temperature using the oral route under the tongue, and I remember to add the extra 0.4-0.6c. However I woke up an hour ago and even though it kinda seemed to have dropped, it came back up in no time, I couldn't take it any more and took another ibuprofen (400mg). This one didn't seem to work as efficiently as it used to, it took about 50 minutes to work, and my temperature barely dropped below 39, I do feel comfortable enough though. Is it normal for a fever to be constant like this? I mean as soon as the meds start to wear off my temperature skyrockets immediately. This is my first time being infected this bad and I'm worried, I got it from my mother who doesn't have any fever at all. "

                            ","I've had Covid 3 times since December 2020 and now have an array of different post covid manifestations.

First, I now have Vertigo. It's a common post covid side effect. I was diagnosed with that a couple weeks after having it the first time and still have bouts of it but my Dr. prescribed Meclezine (spelling?) for that which helps greatly with the dizziness and nausea.

A week before I had it the first time I developed these lesions on my feet that looked like red angry blisters. They showed up between my fingers too. It was painful and there were/are days when I can't wear shoes. It disappeared after I recovered from Covid but then reappeared each time I had Covid again (which was 2 more times after the first time)...AND because I am autoimmune anyway, it pops up now when I so much as get the sniffles.

I also have this weird thing that happens to my face. It too happened a week before I had Covid the first time....and spontaneously happens ever since.

First my eyes will become blood shot. Then my face will turn a fiery red like I had been scalded and become so very hot. My face gets puffy...my eyes get puffy...And then the next day it's completely gone. BUT ...the weirdest thing is two weeks later my face will peel like I had literally been burned.

I also get these wicked headaches once in a while and still occasionally have a residual ""brain fog"". There are days too that I feel so fatigued I can barely keep my eyes open.

My Dr. is stumped. He doesn't know what is happening. Here in Tennessee though, Ivermectin is becoming available as an ""over the counter"" medication and I'm going to take it. I truly believe that Covid is still playing ""the mean girl"" inside of my body and the Ivermectin will (hopefully) get rid of it once and for all....If not, who knows how long I'll have to deal with this...

                            ","The only uplift I've had from long covid, was seeing someone else write about their experiences, and I was like, 'finally! someone else knows!' So I'm going to write my experiences and frustrations too, add them to the pile of stuff that's 'out there.' 

Since I got covid 4 months ago, I've never been right. I describe it as 'good days' and 'bad days'. For the first couple of months, I would swing between days of heavy-limbed tiredness, irritability, intense thirst and hunger, random headaches that can last all day... aand 'good days' where I was fairly symptom free. 

Toward the end of month 3, I had a week, one week of 'good days' and it reminded me what it's like to be me! That shot of regular life feeling was enough for me to really see the difference, it's like night and day. That week of good days was followed by two weeks of bad days, now there's barely a break in the clouds, and I gotta say the symptoms are getting worse. 

I'm 49, but through looks/energy/vibe, I've often been taken for being in my mid thirties. Now I feel like I'm in my frakkin' 60s >< 

My GP won't actually see me, because they're only taking emergency appointments, and have been for two years now. I called 111, and got a callback from a doctor, who easily diagnosed long covid, only to say I had to get a referral from my GP to the Long Covid Clinic.... which, ofc, I cannot do because my own GP won't take that kind of appointment. 

At my work, I asked for a reduction in hours. I worked a lot before, 40-50 hours per week... now it's more like 30-40 per week. But I'm still struggling. i asked for a further hours reduction, but I can't get it. At every level, they say dumb things: My manager, 'you sound like you want to leave.' Her boss: '40 hours goes with your job title, we've done all we can.' His boss, 'yes, let's get you to your GP to see if you're fit for work,' .... well.. that's something else I can't do >< ... aaaand, her boss from Head Office, 'things will seem better when the summer sun comes out.' 

I'm trying to cut down eeeevertying that takes effort, so that I can make it through these days, sometimes spending my whole weekend in bed, sleeping/napping/dozing... for the simple reason, that I can't move! I can sit in a chair, but it's .. head tips back, muslces are heavy, there's nothing I can do.... so I end up going back to bed! I arranged with my laundrette to deliver/pick up washing loads, so that I don't have to. The manager of the laundrette was interested in why I wanted this, and I told him about the long covid. He gave me a doubtful look. 

I'm draggging myself thru these days. I expected every day.. every week... that this would just clear up... I understand that people have reported 6 months or more, I get that its a marathon. But 4 months in, and the symptoms are getting worse. Now I'm hearing there are lots of people who have had this one or two years, and we  dont know if the effects are lifelong in some cases, because we've only got two years of examples to go on. 

I climb stairs every Friday morning, I work in a three storey building just on that particular day. Just as I get to the top, I cough, I always do, and I'm coughing up phlem. Proper, yellow/infected level of stuff is coming up. It's the only time I cough powerfully enough to bring stuff up from my lungs... but every week, without fail, I'm getting this sign of infection from my lungs! What is that about!? How can I have a live infection, week after week like that? 

There's always an extra drain on my system, I can feel it, adding weight to my limbs, tightening my chest, making my breath and body labour over simply walking, or any kind of activity that was once so easy that the effects of it wouldn't even register on my awareness. Now they leave me worn out. 

Even on good days, I'm massively conscious not to overdo things. I've tried exercise to get my body toward fitness quicker, but it takes an entire week to recover from that. Good day + too much activity = loooong string of bad days afterwards. 

It's almost intolerable, and yet everyone reacts with shrugs or disbelief. I'm glad there's something of a community for this, damn,  finally sane responses!

My wife has been struggling with a variety of symptoms ever since receiving the second Pfizer vaccine (October 2021), again after testing positive to Covid (Jan 2022), and again after being a close contact to Covid in April 2022 . Symptoms range from, but usually start in this order on a daily basis;
- Leg pain (thigh area, like an electric shock, feels neurological)
- Dry eyes, mouth and throat.
- All over body aches
- Sore head, like she's been hit across the head.
- Nausea usually in the evenings, but has happened on occasion in the morning.
- Also some feelings of nearly passing out.

Any kind of physical exertion usually worsens symptoms. She constantly needs to rest. Has had every blood test and heart test you can think of. Currently waiting for an appointment with an infections disease doctor. But so far no doctors can help her. She has to manage it on her own with paracetamol and rest.

Any help or ideas on what avenues we should explore would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you!"

Before this, I had no issue getting or holding erections. But after my diagnosis, it's like no matter what I do, I cannot get hard. I did some research and found that ED can be a side effect of Covid, but this early on, that fast? Every article talks about how it's generally something that's a result of long covid. I can't find any articles saying if this is permanent, or if this is something that will subside as my symptoms begin to go away, or if this is just a symptom due to Covid and not a form of Covid induced ED.

She experienced some rather common symptoms: Mild fever, cough and so on. But on day 5 she lost her sense of smell/taste and around that time she also got this strange sensation in the head.

She is having a hard time describing how it feels, but it is very unpleasant and persistent. It's not a headache as such. She describes it as the feeling of electricity going through her brain. She says she feels almost a bit drunk, and I guess it can be best described as a strange kind of migraine.

Painkillers and NSAIDs seem to make no difference. Caffeine/coffee makes no difference (maybe a bit for the worse). Warm baths make no difference. Walks and fresh air makes no difference (maybe momentarily for the worse). We have also tried e.g. ginger, zinc and Q10 but the symptoms remain the same (but maybe such supplements needs a longer period).

She sleeps well and is able to chat, laugh and perform daily tasks without showing any lack of coordination or competence. But she complains that the feeling in the head is constant, intensely uncomfortable and seemingly unchanging. She says that it's much worse than having a headache and she is willing to do anything to make it stop.

                            ","Since the start of the pandemic, I’ve been cleaning each and every piece of shopping that comes into my house with antibacterial wipes. One wipe in each hand, cleaning every inch of each item. It takes hours to do diligently and it’s mentally exhausting. 

Whenever I tell people that this is what I do, they always look at me with eyes that I can see are diagnosing me with OCD. My motivation to continue with these precautions however has come from a number of things. 

1: I can’t be vaccinated in spite of desperately wanting to be. 

2: I have bronchiectasis, so therefore am especially susceptible to the virus. 

3: I am immunocompromised. 

I’ve been reading articles saying that it’s no longer necessary to disinfect your shopping; however, in the same breath, these articles that claim to be channelling science also state the importance of hand-washing before and after handling groceries you’ve just purchased. Surely if that’s what the science is saying, it’s also indicating that it’s important to thoroughly clean the items that are making it necessary for you to wash your hands? Surely if the shopping’s dirty enough to make hand-washing a requirement after touching it, it’s dirty enough to requiring cleaning itself? 

Also, while the hygiene requirements of shop workers is considered in the scientific findings, what about other factors that could potentially contaminate your food? Would a considered factor be...the lady who walks off the bus with her child, only to then pick them up and stand them in a shopping trolly to walk all over the area your shopping touches in the shoes they’ve walked through vomit and canine excrement in? Can that be quantified into science? 

I’d like to know if sanitising shopping is still required - because it seems like it is, but it’s also a huge drain on my life and time resources. Thanks in advanced. "

When the other symptoms (fever, muscle pain, joint pain) began to intensify on days 2 and 3, I started to take extra strength Tylenol (aspirin is contraindicated for me).  Within 30 mins of taking 2 of the Tylenol, the sensitivity was gone.  Unfortunately, like clockwork, when the 8 hour dose of Tylenol ran out, the sensitivity returned just as strong as before.  I am now on day 7 - and - although the other symptoms have rapidly dissipated (using the I-mask+ protocol), the skin issues continue unabated.  I have done some research and found this to be a relatively rare symptom of COVID that sometimes spontaneously resolve without treatment - but I have seen no discussion about how to treat this symptom while it persists.

My boyfriend tested positive for covid (he is symptomatic) last Sunday (1/16). I have tested everyday since and am still negative. We live in the same house, sleep in the same bed and I have not exactly been ""distanced"" from each other. The previous Friday we were with three other people, all of them tested positive as well (assuming we had a server, bartender or were all around the same person that had it). This is not the first time this has happened for me. I have been around at least 10 other people throughout the pandemic that I have later learned, tested positive. I am sure the vaccine has definitely assisted my immune system in fighting off the virus. 

Another strange coincidence (or not), is that my brother's girlfriend also contracted the virus and he never got it either. 

My question here is, should I assume I have some sort of built-up immunity or antibodies? Maybe I have already had covid without knowing. Is there somewhere in particular that I could donate my blood for research? I would love to do that if anyone knows of anywhere that I could do so. I'm guessing if I do not have the antibodies, maybe something in particular in my DNA or my blood type?

Thank you for any assistance,
Kathryn"

My body temperature drops as low as 90° Fahrenheit sometimes and during this time I start to lose consciousness. My body feels lethargic, I have high blood pressure and eventually I start sweating.

Indications of these episodes are sweating, dizziness, body ache, and trepidation.

This has affected my lifestyle immensely. I’m only 18 years old. I had these episodes during my final exams as well. I’m also experiencing loss of appetite. Eating heavy or fried foods also cause these episodes. The only thing that helps out is a strong black tea or consuming warm milk or water.

For the last 3 weeks I have been testing positive on lateral flow tests. Faint lines, but definitely there. I've done 9 positive lateral flow tests in total and taken 3 PCR tests over this time, all of which came back negative.
To my knowledge I've been lucky enough to completely avoid catching covid so far (touch wood) so I don't think it's something residual hanging on from having had it before, and even if it was and I was just unaware, surely the PCR tests would pick it up?
The lateral flow tests I am continuously testing positive on are the new Flowflex ones. And no, I haven't had any lemon juice before taking them! (I hear that causes false positives!)
I can't find much on the Internet to say other people are experiencing this. I have no symptoms of covid and I'm certain I don't currently have it. 
I also don't think it's a dodgy batch of Flowflex tests either, because my husband has used the same ones with a clear negative result.
Am I just defective or is anyone else having the same trouble?

2 days ago I received my booster shot of Moderna. The injection site is a bit swollen and red, which is normal I think. But since yesterday evening there's also a red spot a few centimeters from the injection site. It only hurts a little when I press it, kind of like a bruise. Should I be concerned? Could this be a warning sign of thrombosis? I added a photo of the red spots.

                            ","I am writing this to talk about COVID-19 vaccinations and why I think everyone should get vaccinated. Personally, I think it is just the responsible thing to do because it not only helps protect you but it also protects those around you. I think people should do it just to look out for their loved ones. Although I understand people do not agree and believe it is unsafe. That is what I am planning to discuss. 
People’s fear of the vaccine- that being that it came out too fast and is unsafe- is very understandable; I’m not going to lie, I was very skeptical of it at the beginning. When it first became available to people, I was thinking the same thing I’m sure a lot of people were thinking, such as: how do we know this is safe? It came out way too fast, there is no way they were able to do enough tests on this, they don’t know what the long term effects of this could be. After reading many non-biased and trustworthy articles over the vaccine, I do now believe it is safe and I think everyone should be receiving it. First off, scientists have been working on creating a SARS-CoV vaccine for more than 50 years meaning they have existing data on the structure, genome, and life cycle of this type of virus. In order to create the vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), scientists only had to manipulate the S-protein of the SARS-CoV vaccine. Since time was a luxury the world could not afford, scientists all over the world came together to create the COVID-19 vaccine as quickly and safely as possible. Being able to all compare their research on SARS-CoV, made it easier for them to come up with a safe vaccine for that, therefore leading to creating the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. 
Since scientists have been able to do research and conduct testing SARS-CoV vaccines for the past many years, I believe it shows us that this COVID-19 vaccine actually did not come out too fast. It is the same virus as SARS-CoV, it just has a different S-protein strand which was easy for scientists to manipulate. I truly do believe this vaccine is safe and it is the only way we will be able to get past this. If you believe you’ll be fine if you get the virus because you’re young and healthy then think about others for a second. Sure, you may be fine and it may not affect you,  but it will/has affect those around you. We have lost 5.2 million people worldwide to this disease. We need to do everything in our power to stop this disease, and that requires thinking of others before yourself and getting vaccinated.

For the past couple of years I've enjoyed a beer or two after work every couple of days. 

I would drink like I normally do, with no side effects at all. I would always moderate myself and not drink more than 2 beers a day every 2-3 days. 

Last month, I tested positive for Covid-19, lost my smell and taste and felt ill over a week but got back on my feet with a bit of fatigue here and there and I thought I got away scot - free. 

That was until I drunk a beer a week after I got better and instantly started sneezing, coughing and suffered from a runny nose for two days. I didn't think much of it and continued to drink here and there with the exact same symptoms lingering on for 2 days. 

I don't have any food allergies I know of. Ive always enjoyed food with nothing to worry about. 

To this day, a month on I can't happily drink beer without a consistent cough, runny nose and sneezing. 

I believe this might have to do with covid because the day before I tested positive and felt a bit off, I had a beer with no symptoms. 

Does anyone know what might have caused this new allergy/intolerance or what it might be? 

I appreciate anyone who takes the time read and respond

Thank you"

However, I feel maybe I will get a more sympathetic response here. I live in Bristol England in case that’s relevant.
January 2020 my 18 year old daughter was very sick with a constant - every few seconds cough that lasted for days. She hardly ever gets sick. She had a mild fever and had fatigue. My son and I had very mild flu like symptoms. Since then I have had various random symptoms. A really scary episode where my vision and balance went crazy for a few hours followed by quite a few more milder episodes. Shaking and kind of spasms occasionally. My neighbour who I hang out with was taken to hospital a few months later and put on oxygen despite testing negative for COVID 3 times.
A a few months later I had a few days of feeling poorly with more dizzy spells I took a COVID test. Later that day I got the first nosebleed I have ever had. We all assumed I had irritated my nostril with the swab. Result was negative. The nosebleeds became so extreme it was coming out my eyes and I was in A &E many times and eventually admitted as an in patient and ‘fixed’ in the most painful way.
When my daughter went to her first year at Leeds university she had the same kind of episode of illness she had had previously but perhaps more cold like symptoms but still the cough. That week everyone in her tower block were testing positive for COVID.
A month or two ago I went to see my daughter in Leeds as she was experiencing the same kind of illness only this time she had obviously developed tonsillitis and conjunctivitis alongside the coughing /sore throat. Her flatmates were also poorly but not so bad. After staying with her for two days after not having nosebleeds for months I suddenly got one out of the blue and they escalated in severity again. Leeds student accommodation then suddenly became one of the hot spots of covid with flat mate testing positive. The flatmate was one who hadn’t tested positive previously.
Now in Bristol which has recently become a hotspot my neighbour suddenly had uncontrollable shaking followed by a temperature (39.5) but unusually cold hands. His oxygen level was 95. He felt generally unwell and tired but recovered after 24 hours, apart from a very swollen foot. He had been double vaccinated as have I. He had recently played table tennis at a community centre where my friend’s son has just had to isolate as his team leaders had tested positive after playing table tennis in the same room. My neighbour tested negative 3 times. I just had an episode of sudden hot ear and then cheek for a few hours and felt pretty tired. On the same side as my nosebleeds. My children had a weird reoccurrence of mild eczema.
Is this all just coincidence? I’m wondering if we are possibly catching covid again and again - every time our bodies come into contact with it it is doing it’s best to fight it off and thankfully for my family and friends it seems the symptoms are reducing - possibly due to immunity and vaccinations.
I apologise for this long message but I haven’t seen anyone that has been experiencing anything similar and am just really interested if anyone has similar stories of being exposed to covid again and having symptoms and yet testing negative possibly because our bodies are doing so well at fighting it off we don’t have enough virus in us to test positive.

I need some advice for my child.

3-4 weeks ago my partner and I contacted Covid-19.  Just as we were coming to the end of our isolation my 4 year old daughter developed hives on her hands and feet which one hive was covering the entire sole of her left foot! After plenty of sleep and immune boosting foods the hives went away and we are now left with itchy red skin on her hands and feet that are pealing a lot. Is there anything we can do to help make this go away? Has anyone else experienced this? Is this related to covid-19?

any help would be much appreciated!

My husband had his first Covid vaccine back in April and he had the AstraZeneca vaccine.

He was extremely poorly for about 5 days with it, he was struggling with breathing, awful fever, vomiting, unable to eat, not sleeping, struggling to drink and severe aching. We did contact the doctor as he never moans about illness's but he was really really bad with this and the doctor said over the phone this was normal and he would be fine in a week.

He had to cancel all his jobs he had booked in as he couldn't move which hit us financially again after the lockdown. He refused to get his 2nd jab after the way he felt.

I am desperate for him to get his 2nd jab and he said he will only go ahead if its the Phizer vaccine. I have tried to ring up to see if its too late for him to have his 2nd jab and is it possible to have the Phizer but they didn't really know if it was too late. They said they think the 1st jab has probably expired by now and to contact the doctor. I have tried to get a telephone appointment with the doctor but they are refusing to book and appointment and asked me to ring the Covid line but they are asking me to ring the doctor....no one will speak to me and i'm worried with all the cases at the moment, if he gets Covid i will lose him!

Does anyone have any advice if its too late to get a 2nd dose nearly 6 months after the 1st jab?

Or, will they give him a 1st jab again and then a 2nd jab?

Is it possible to have Phizer if he didn't have that the first time as he can't have that again?

Thank you all x"

I have just completed the 10 days isolation after having tested positive for covid.

At the time I was abroad so I extended my stay there to complete the isolation period.
I then wanted to travel back to the UK where I live, from all the information I found online it seems that after having tested positive, future PCR tests can still show up as positive for up to 3 months.

When arriving at the Eurostar to travel back to the UK, they would not let me through without a negative test even after explaining the situation, and showing proof by my doctor that I tested positive and completed the isolation period and have no symptoms.

They then told me to do a quick test in a pharmacy in the train station and somehow (I have no idea how) the result was negative, without this they would not let me travel back to the UK at all.

Which to me seems they didn't think through this kind of situation...

Now before being allowed on the train I also had to book the day 2 and day 8 PCR test (hasn't been 2 weeks since my second dose yet) so now back in the UK I have to complete 2 more test and I'm very aware that these could show up positive again... resulting in being seen as a new infection while it obviously wouldn't be.

To me this makes no sense, I called NHS multiple times and it seems like everybody just has no idea themselves.
I was wondering if anybody has been in a similar situation?

Another question I have, on the NHS app it says as one of the 4 reasons to get a NHS COVID Pass:

'Natural immunity
If you've previously tested positive for COVID-19 using a PCR test, and it's been at least 10 days since your positive result, you are eligible for an NHS COVID Pass for up to 180 days from the test date.'

Now it's been over 10 days and this hasn't showed up, I called NHS about this and it even seems like thre is no record of my postive test on my profile... 
How do I get this NHS COVID pass after having tested positive?

Sorry for the long message, really hope to get some help :)

Have a nice day"

Early June 2021, I tested Covid negative.


Starting around July 10, 2021, I stopped wearing a mask in public, as everyone around me seemed to have stopped too.

Around July 15, 2021, I started feeling some symptoms I thought were related to a cold.  Mild cold sweats, inability to get to sleep easily at night, but no fatigue - I continued to go to the gym and exercise hard during this period.

July 17, 2021, I felt some cold sweats during the day, tiny bit of solid phlegm coughed up, very mild cough.

July 20, 2021, I tested Covid positive.


My wife has had similar mild symptoms, starting round July 20, 2021, although she has had no cough, no phlegm, but yes runny nose .  (I have not had a runny nose at all.)  She too has experienced no fatigue.  Must assume that I gave her the Covid, as she has been in contact with no one other than me during this period.  I am the only one who has been leaving the house during this period.  She hasn't yet actually tested positive, but assume that she has it.

We will both go for a follow up test next week.


My sense of smell and taste not affected.

Her sense of smell only affected, but she thinks it might just be due to nasal congestion.

No fever at any point - my temperature has been around 97.5 F which is normal for me; hers around 98.1 F which is normal for her.

We have isolated and are avoiding contact with anyone since July 18, 2021, other than when I went to take the test July 20th.

We both feel mild mild dizziness if we exert ourselves, similar to trying to exercise with a bacterial cold.

I am a  week into this virus, i lost taste and smell on day 2. My first Q is, if you also lost your smell and taste, when did they return? Secondly, i know this may sound strange but any advice on what to eat? i cant stomach much of anything I've tried- pasta, toast, chicken, rice, chilli, sandwiches etc...
Fruit and jelly seem to be the most palatable but they don't fill me up and i go to bed extremely hungry and just pray tomorrow is a better day but i'm starting to feel weak now and its making me feel really low. 
any advice is appreciated :)"

I isolated, but only really had to stay all day in bed maybe 2x. I had energy to shower, change etc.  After 2 weeks i started having heart palpatations.  i would breathe through it or walk. One day the palpatations came with my left arm feeling slightly numb. I freaked as i thought i could possibly be having a stroke. i took myself to urgent care. they took EKG, listened to my lungs and performed some tests. Everything seemed ok. thought maybe just anxiety. but a couple more times as im laying down, my heart will race with some pins n needles feelings on my left side and going to my cheek and chest.  its periodic not sure what to think.  i was a healthy 49 yr old with no underlying conditions.  Am i still recovering? or do i have a health issue as a result of Covid. ?"

I'm 40M and totally devastated at the moment due to debilitating symptoms that started 3 weeks post covid infection (tested positive on 10/6/21). My initial Covid symptoms were moderate (treated at home) and I didn't get any breathing/lungs problems. However, I had severe stomach pain, diarrhea, nausea and appetite loss. These symptoms improved overtime but then I developed new set of symptoms: occasional blood in stool, occasional burning stomach after eating, extreme lightheadedness/dizziness/feeling woozy (ESPECIALLY AFTER EATING), extreme hair loss, tinnitus, light sensitivity (can't stand bright sun light), blurry vision and tingling/itching head. I went on and got many tests done:

- MRI brain scan. Normal
- CBC (WBC, RBC). Normal (hemoglobin normal)
- Inflammation markers (CRP; ESR; D-dimer; Ferritin). Normal

- 24-Hour blood pressure monitoring. Systolic blood presure ranges between 100-130 (ave. 103) & Diastolic blood pressure ranges beteeen 58-80 (ave. 60). It seems my Diastolic bloop pressure is sometimes borderline low.

- Blood sugar. Ranges between 4-6 on most times. However, I tend to get low blood sugar problems including lightheadedness even when numbers are normal?

- Kidney function (Creatinine; Sodium; Potassium; Chloride). Within normal range

- Cortisol. Not tested

- Liver Enzymes (AST; ALT; Albumin). Normal
- Heart rate monitor. Had tachycardia during the first month post covid but now it's in the 65-85 range.
- Zinc level. Normal
- Serum iron. Currently normal (was low 3 weeks ago)
- Calcium level: Normal

- SaO2. 98%-100%
- Upper Endoscopy for stomach + duodenum. Unremarkable & no indication of H. pylori
- H-Pylori breathing test. Negative
- Ear balance test. Normal
- Coagulation test. normal

Like I said,  extreme lightheadedness/dizziness/feeling woozy is my worst symptom and it gets 10x after eating. 

Question:
Can gastritis cause lightheadedness? could it be blood circulation problem leading to less blood flow the brain? Are eye sensitivity to light and tingling head related to decreased blood flow? should I go for colonoscopy to rule out ulcers and other abnormalities? Are there any other necessary tests? 

Is there anyone who had similar experience? is there a solution? I'm suffering everyday :(

She recommended I hold off on getting vaccinated because she said the vaccine could make me feel really sick since my antibodies were already high. I recently got a second antibody test, which said my IgG antibody level is now 250. My Dr said she has never seen anyone’s level increase and she had no idea why it would. She said 250 is really high, and that the level for someone who has been vaccinated is usually over 100.

I found conflicting information regarding wait times for getting the vaccine after having covid so decided to book my appointment and find out for definite when I went. 

At my appointment the nurse said it would be fine so I went ahead. It wasn't until I started feeling really unwell over the next week that I found out the official guidance was to wait 4 weeks after your positive test. It was only 2 weeks and 4 days after my positive test that I had the vaccine so I am now concerned that having it too soon might result in health problems. 

Is it actually dangerous to have the vaccine too close to a covid infection or has it just been put in place so that covid symptoms and vaccine side effects won't be confused? "

By Saturday afternoon I noticed 2 spots on my leg and my stomach that appeared to be an allergic reaction, or maybe bug bites, they have since disappeared.

On Sunday I noticed 2 new spots near my vaccination spot on my left arm, along with other smaller spots I guess are called hives. The spots are itchy but mostly on contact.

I also noticed something very weird since it had never happened to me before, some kind of white spots that look like something dried up, at first it made me think of dried yogurt, but obviously it's not the case, they aren't itchy or painful, and one of them actually was removed with water gentle rubbing.

Is this a reaction to the vaccine? I'm not sure if I should see a doctor for this or if it's even related to the vaccine, but I have not eaten or been in contact with anything new either.

Tuesday my cold continued - just sneezing and runny nose - nothing else. My boss said - do a lateral flow just to be on the safe side - it came up positive!!!

went home inmediately. did another and also positive.

wednesday had runny nose and sneezing all day. felt absokutelt fine. by 5pmish all my sense of taste and smell gone. great!

wake up today and still positive on lateral flow. nose no longer runny - just a bit blocked. sneezing now and again. but i cant taste or smell anything.

im still in shock i have covid after vaccine. i feel so guilty - obviously off work for sometime now but i feel absolutely fine. obviously i will obey all rules. guessing it hasnt hit me as much because of vaccines. just i know ive been to work with worst colds.

my question is - anyone else had covid as light touch as this? do tou know how long it took to be clear?

how long does this awful loss of taste and smell last for.  i feel completely fit and well except for sneezing and this lack of smell / taste.

started Saturday with sneezes so guessing i would have tested positive then. so... this would be day six for me.

For some context, I'm a mid/late thirties male, I don't have any known health issues, I have a healthy BMI and have always maintained an exercise regimen (mostly running 3 times a week) to stay reasonably fit. I don't smoke and very rarely drink. I have never had any cardio health issues.

I had my first shot of the Pfizer vaccine almost 8 weeks ago and it went well- I basically had no symptoms that I can recall. My arm didn't even get sore- the only time I would feel pain in my arm is if I fully extended it in front me, and even then it was very mild. I think I was a bit ""fatigued"" at the end of the same day- but I'm not even sure that it was a result of the vaccine. I do suffer from intermittent bouts of insomnia which may have caused it; not sure. The fatigue didn't have ""different feel"" about it.

So essentially what I'm asking is- can I ""estimate"" how my body will react to the second dose, given how it reacted to first dose? Since my body reacted ""well"" to the first dose (no problems)- do I have a ""better"" chance at having no adverse reactions (i.e. heart inflammation) when I get my second dose?"

Suddenly it reaches to 44% and I admitted to hospital and doctors straight forward said SORRY! There is no cure! My luck that a senior doctor came and he prescribed Actemra (Tocilizumab) Injection.  In 4 days, they injected 4 injections to me and I started to get better. My oxygen reached 88 in 10 days. My doctor gave me Rivaroxaban for 30 days and my D dimers got better.

Doctor said you had ARDS. 

I've some questions if you people don't mind to give me some answers and help me.

1- Did ARDS happen to me due to COVID?
2- Did clots produce due to COVID or ARDS?
3- Once clots finishes, can they become again?
4- Once ARDS finishes, can it happen again in life without any reason and is it treatable?
5- For what they used Actemra Injection for me?

I am from Holland and I am looking for some information and reassurance. In my own country I can't seem to find any information.

Currently, the Astrazeneca, J&J, Pfizer and Moderna vaccine are widely discussed in the news. These could potentially have rare side effects and cause clots and low platelets. 

I have had severe HELLP syndrome. This is also a rare serious disease that occurs in only 02, up to 0.6 percent of all pregnant women and also causes low platelets and clots. My body is therefore certainly able to cause this immune response, partly by non-body substances (half of the DNA is from the partner). This is something I never hope to experience again. And I am now terribly afraid of being vaccinated with 1 of these vaccines. Although I would very much like this partly because I belong to the risk group with asthma. 

Are there any women here who have had pre-eclampsia or HELLP syndrome who have already been vaccinated? And have you experienced any side effects?"

Then In had the symptoms of corona in the 23 of march 2020,
* 1st day: Shivering, headache, diarrhea, couldn't eat
* 2nd day: sorethroat at mid day, couldn't eat
* 3rd day: started eating, sorethroat ended at mid day, blocked nose at night with lump in throat (solved the blocked nose with spray o.w I wouldn't breath)
* 4th day: same as 3rd day

I wasn't eligible for test so I had to stay only at home. After these 4 days and I started feeling progress, then I suddenly noticed 
* breathing problems after lunch only. 
* A lot of burping, 
* dead skin around my nose 
* needles feeling in my chest
* Frequent red itchy skin at the lymphoid gland area as well as red itchy skin on the esophagus area
* Can't talk a lot or shout as I feel sensitive in my throat


In June my esophagus was so inflamed that after touching the area of lymphoid gland, I had a fast heart beat and I went to do corona test which came negative. I went to the doctor who doubted that I have reflux and after trying Proton pump inhibitors for two weeks nothing changed and then he asked me to do a spectroscopy and we found nothing. Strangely that I found a friend of a friend that had the same symptoms but she even had blood coming from her throat. She did the spectroscopy and found that it was Helicobacter Pylori is the reason. My doctor simply told me, don't be scared because it seems to be a psychological problem.


I read online to see life habits to decrease the effect of reflux and what really made a difference was to avoid sitting in the bed before sleeping. That removed the most harsh symptom of breathing problems after lunch. Yet I went on with a lot of burping, daily dead skin around my nose and needles feeling in my chest and around every 3 weeks to have red itchy skin over lymphoid and esophagus.


Now that a year has passed and I am still having the same symptoms plus frequent numbness in the back of my feet and my feet nails is getting destroyed.  I have read in a publication that Helicobacter pylori bacteria increases the ace 2 receptors which covid19  use as a host cell and another paper today that Helicobacter pylori is the reason behind lymphoid gland problems. 


Does anyone facing the same problems or something similar, know any extra information that I might be missing or have advice?

1 day ago, I got my 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine and this time after the vaccine I took 2 extra strength Tylenol as I heard that the symptoms are much worse.  However my arm didn't hurt as much although it did hurt.  I did feel a very slight case of chills that night.   I also felt aches and pains the next day and my arm was swollen.  I took 2 tylenol every 6 hours for a total of 4 times.  On the last dose, my arm pain almost completely disappeared and I pretty much felt back to normal about 28 hours after receiving the 2nd dose.

Not bad and certainly not as bad as some vaccine reaction stories I've hear from others.  I would also say that my experience seems to confirm that the 2nd dose can elicit a bit more or stronger reactions than the 1st dose.

GET THE VACCINE AS SOON AS YOU CAN!  I feel relieved now that I've had my 2nd dose and glad that I will be contributing to achieving herd immunity."

I know the vacs that we have both had provide some protection, but its all to do with probability.

They don't know if that is caused by the vaccine or because they drank some water which I gave them and I did not realise until afterwards that the water bottle they used all day was visibly dirty with grime.

I would like to know if diarrhea will affect their body's ability to process the vaccine. I have tried to find the answer on the internet but there are a lot of sites and none seem to cover things which could reduce the effectiveness of the vaccine. 

So can anyone help me understand the issues that diarrhea will cause?

My covid symptoms started last Wednesday April 21 with nasal congestion, runny nose and sneezing. By Monday my temp was 37.7 and I started taking tylenol every 4-6 hours which eliminated the fever. Yesterday, I skipped my afternoon tylenol to see how my body would react and my temp was 37.5 and I feel kind of off like I was going to get a fever. So I took the tylenol and it went back down. My sense of smell is coming back, but I have this dry cough that whenever I inhale deeply I feel this hard tickle in my throat and I have to cough it out. I'm also pregnant at 27 weeks, and I am so scared of developing covid pneumonia.

Any advice/tips? Has anyone else experienced a cough with the strong tickle in the throat?"

So do we have some good idea of what the worst plausible case of Covid would be like for someone who has been fully vaccinated? Apparently it wouldn't rise to the level of what the CDC considers ""severe disease"". For someone without complicating factors, are we talking about something like a bad bout of seasonal flu, with no lingering effects?

                            ","Okay so a bit about my family.

My husband works at IT, he got his first dose of the vaccine, as did I, and we are waiting for our 2nd. (I am a stay at home mother.) We have a 4 year old daughter and an almost 1 year old who has an SVT since 2 months old. 

We have been practically in a bubble. My husband works (masks required) and we do get groceries once a month (usually we do grocery pick up but we are on WIC so we do stop once a month to get WIC items.) The only people we have seen since this all began are my parents, who take it VERY serious, and my SIL, who also does.

My parents have been fully vaccinated (yay) now, but now that they have been, my sisters family will be visiting them every now and then. My sister's family does not take it serious at all, refuses to vaccinate or wear masks or social distance. 

We know that there IS a possibility of spreading it even after being fully vaccinated, so we aren't sure how long we should stay away from my parents when they visit my sisters family. 

I talked to her pediatrician and she had said it was ""up to us"" on how we felt.. either wait 2 weeks, or wait a week and see if they have symptoms. 

The WIC clinic told me that it was ""very rare for someone vaccinated to pass it on"" and that we ""probably didn't have to worry"". 

But others have told me not to risk it and do a full 2 week of distancing from them. 

So I'm confused now. It'll be a week, Saturday, since my parents have seen my sisters family. They have some health problems  unrelated to covid (they both had had covid tests before this as they have had to go to the hospitals a few times for testing to see what's going on) but they have no covid symptoms. 

Should we still quarantine another week with no contact, should we see them but have them wear masks (they have said they would if we wanted them to), or is it safe enough, since they are fully vaccinated and have been very careful for a week with no symptoms, to see them?

I know covid isn't as likely to be dangerous for children, but since our daughter had a heart condition (which we can thankfully say she has not had an episode since October now! but back in June-July it spiked her heart rate due to a simple fever she got) we have been scared to let anyone near the household. 

My parents are our only outlet, so we're hoping we will be able to see them sooner, but I will do whatever is safest for our kids too."

I am 35 in decent health and my symptons were minor aches and fever for about the first 3-4 days with slight dizziness and headaches off and on for about 7-8 days.

When I was leaving we talked for a few minutes and I mentioned that I had tested positive but had also quarantined for the 14 days instead of the 10 recommended by the CDC. Unfortunately she was very upset that I even came by and didn't tell her first. She was also bothered that I would even be out in the first place. I did wear a mask the entire time and maintained distance as well. She is only around 30 years old although she has had some health problems.

I am not really sure what to do or how to respond to all of her angry texts that she has been sending me from panic even though I explained that I was careful to quarantine for longer than required and also that I am feeling fine.

Question 1: the proteins are produced by cells that presumably go on to replicate, with the mRNA changes incorporated in their replications. Then the replicated cells produce more viral proteins, which our immune system will presumably attack. What happens when the number of modified cells is producing enough viral protein to overwhelm the immune system?

Question 2: Why does the body launch an immune response to something that is produced by our cells? Why does it not recognise that the viral proteins are produced internally, and so should not be attacked?

Question 3: If the immune system is attacking viral protein, what will it do when it sees, not just the “spike”, but the whole virus?

Question 4: What will happen when someone who has had the vaccine, and so is producing viral protein, is trying to conceive a child with someone who hasn’t had the vaccine, so may recognise the other person’s sex cells as “foreign” and attack them?

                            ","After testing positive on Feb 9, I finally tested negative and showed antibodies on Feb 22, 4 days ago.

I have gone back to my activities which mean staying at my desk for several hours.

Earlier today I had just gone down and up the stairs at work, and within minutes of sitting down again I felt a sudden sharp pain in my right calf. It had never happened before and I didn't hurt myself or anything like that. Then I also started experiencing a slight feeling of warmth, not really on the whole leg but my foot feels warm.

Minutes later I also felt another jolt of pain close to the arch my foot.

A week ago I  had a couple of blood tests to check for anything odd, my D Dimer levels were both times within range, and it actually went down by a single digit the second time. My doctor checked it all and said they were fine and since they weren't increasing it wasn't a problem.

I don't notice any swelling so far and the leg isn't painful to the touch, I actually haven't felt the pain since that one time. Although it does feel slightly weird, like loose but not really, and like I said the calf isn't painful any more.

Could these be DVT symptoms almost a week after getting better of Covid, and with 2 previous blood tests showing no sign of coagulation problems?

Or is this just a bad coincidence?"

Thought I would pop on here to share my experience of Covid. I'll bulletpoint to keep it simple. 

*14th&15th Dec, I was in contact with someone who tested positive for covid (they tested positive on the 16th)
*21st Dec - experienced sharp shooting pains all over my body - not constant and did not interfere with daily activities. 
* 23rd Dec - feeling extremely tired but didn't interfere with daily activities, minor loss of taste. 
* 24th Dec - still tired, sharp pains gone. Felt like I had small blobs of phlegm stuck in my throat - not low enough to cough up and not high enough to blow out nose.  Not very hungry.
* 25th Dec - the person I was in contact with passed away. (he DID have numerous underlying health conditions and sepsis from a UTI). Ability to smell and taste things 90% gone.
* 28th Dec - go for a test. Feeling tired and breathless - this was thankfully minor and manageable. OK when I sit in the warm. 
* 29th Dec - Positive result. I felt so so scared. I live in a with my Fiance and his mum. We are all in separate rooms - isolating. Never felt so alone and scared. 
* 30th Dec to 2nd Jan - every night, going to bed anxious. Scared of getting worse, scared incase I have the same fate as the friend we lost. Weird dreams about food and craving food! Taste and smell came back over these days to about 80%. Breathlessness getting better but still taking it easy and listening to my body. 
* 3rd Jan - developed 1 patch of rash. The 'Herald spot' for pityriasis rosea (confirmed by a DR)
* Recovering day by day. 

21/01/21 - I am back at work as of a couple weeks ago. Still feel like I have hayfever every now and then. Managed to go for a small run last weekend (Usually run 5k at least twice a week) - went better than I thought. I still have the rash and the sharp shooting pains have come back and bite every now and then. 

I must admit the worst experience of it all for me was the anxiety that came with it. You only hear and see negatives on the news and after my friend passing, it was really hard to think I would get off lightly. 

I'm still not 100% but I am hoping that as time goes by, I will gradually get back to my normal self. Time will tell I guess. 

If anyone wants to ask me anything etc, please let me know. Happy to help anyone if I can from my experience.

Earlier today I also noticed a sudden nasal discharge, clear liquid, coming out of both sides for a moment, although I want to believe it was due to the food I had just eaten.

I have suffered mild body aches and nausea with has led to me not really wanting to eat much. 
Just as of today (day 3) I have noticed a change in my sense of smell however i can still taste fine.

Could easily be a cold as i have suffered no cough and my temperature at its highest was only 37.4 which is very low grade.

I had my second blood tests done yesterday which confirmed DDimer and Fibrinogen levels are still or went back into their appropriate ranges, C-Reactive Protein went down almost within its range as well. So far Ferritin is the only one that has gone up, up to twice its max value actually, currently at **500.61 ng/ml**, max should be about 275, 3 days before it was at **338.5 ng/ml **  so that's a significant increase too as far as I can tell. I haven't heard back from my doctor yet. But as far as I've seen this goes up when there is immune system hyper inflammation, which can cause serious problems.

Since last night and until today I have felt as if my chest is heavier than usual, if I try a deep breath it feels as if I have something on me causing pressure, or like very tight constricting clothing. 

My blood oxygen levels are normal, they range between 98% - 100%. Everytime I have been checked out by my doctor I have no problem reaching 100% either. 

Blood pressure is also fine, heart beat rate is fine, 60 - 90 depending on the situation.

So my question is, since most markers are fine, except for that one, could this be considered a bad indicator? Is this really what shortness of breath feels like?  Or just some anxiety induced fear symptom that I'm getting?

I feel like it would be too easy to blame it on axiety, especially since the risk is real given that most Covid related deaths happen in the immune response stage I'm in."

I should be on day 11 since symptoms onset this Sunday, and on Saturday, day 10, my doctor had me do some blood tests to see how I'm doing internally.

We reviewed them today and they weren't very good. I had high fibrinogen levels (634.3 mg/dL, range should be 250-600), high ferritin levels (338.5 ng/ml, range should be 21-274), high globular sedimentation rate (31 mm/hr, range should be 0-15), highC-Reactive Protein (1.31 mg/dL, range should be 0-0.5), among other values.

Dimer-D was high but within range (245 ng/ml, range should be 0-255).

I was basically told this was expected given the Covid infection, but that it still raised my chance of very severe complications like 100 times.

My doctor said we weren't going to try anything just yet, I'm getting a new blood test next Tuesday, 3 days after the first one to see if things are improving and if so we're gonna leave it alone. But if they stay the same or God forbid get worse, then we're gonna try some real deal medications like blood thinners and such.

So what I expected was gonna be a good visit to the doctor since, like I said, I feel fine, turned out to be literally heartbreaking, knowing I have inner inflammation, my blood is thickening and who knows what else.

Is all this normal? Has this been observed on others that you know of? How has it progressed? What can I expect? I'm crying.

A  staff member immediately asked me to remove my mask and replace it with one of theirs which was one of these (useless) blue surgical masks. I was somewhat stunned by this. Needless to say there was no way I was going to comply and I was quite prepared to go home if necessary. Eventually after some discussion a doctor was called and she said my mask was the best available and there was no problem. A second doctor then requested me to wear a blue surgical mask over mine. I did not object to this since I could see that his intention was to give the impression of uniformity.  All proceeded well until I eventually got to the vaccination station. There were four or five staff sitting as close together as it was possible to be. There was also a seat for me right next to them where I was requested to sit while they prepared the vaccine. I declined and said I would prefer to maintain a 2 metre distance except when the vaccine was being given.  The staff members didn't seem to understand why I was reluctant to sit near them! Thank goodness I had a decent mask on. I later complained to NHS Healthwatch and subsequently received a reply from the centre  supervisor saying ""I am very disappointed to hear of your experience. Only this morning I gave a briefing to all the staff regarding the importance of social distancing"". He also said he would look into this further. From what I have seen on TV, my experience is far from unique. What on earth is wrong with people when even the medics at the nerve centre can't comply with the most basic regulations."

My 78 year old mom tested covid positive nov 13, 20 days ago.  She had mild symptoms - body ache, cough but never had a fever or needed O2.

She is currently in a rehab facility, was originally in for an infection (before covid) but was well enough to come home, then caught covid.  Before covid she cold walk 35+ feet with her walker, did all of her exercises and could do her toiletries.

Now she has trouble walking more than a few feet and only gets out of bed every couple of days.

What's worrying me though is the ""brain fog"" thing.  Before covid she was lucid and mentally sharp - ready to come home.  Now she has ""blank spots"" where she can't remember anything during parts of covid.  She also is speaking slower (though that is improving) but has issues with memory and things like day/date.  

So my Questions:
- how long does this ""brain fog"" typically last?  Is it permanent?  Does anything help with this?

Any info on this greatly appreciated,
Rob"

Monday and Tuesday I felt more tired than usual, as after you exercise a lot but nothing more.

On Thursday and Wednesday I was also in contact with another person who also turned out to be positive by Thursday.

On Wednesday I got PCR tested and on Thursday was told I was negative.

Both Thursday and Friday I had throbbing headaches for several hours, the kind that makes it painful when you shake your head.

Since Friday night and until Sunday so far I've felt I've had a fever, although I don't have a temperature reading. I've also felt joint/muscle pain especially in lower back and legs.

Since Saturday I've also had pain when moving my eyes side to side, kind of like eye strain but I'm not sure it could be related to the fever.

My usual resting heartbeat should be around 60-70 bpm, but these last couple days I've seen it go up to the 90-100 bpm range and even once up to 110 bpm, only to later come back to 70-80 bpm.

I have not experienced other symptoms such as cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, chest pressure, loss of smell or taste, etc.

Sometimes I feel a slight itch in my throat that disappears when drinking water.

I'm thinking I might get tested tomorrow again. Do you think the passed time between contacts with covid positive people is enough to actually show up if I have it? Or should I consider this might not be covid and pursue another kind of medical attention?

If in fact covid, does this is seem like a ""mild"" case so far? I'm male, 31 with no diagnosed health conditions."

(I want to add that, I never had a mental disorder before.  I sport and eat healthy, and all was fine. ) I spoked with my family, and asked the question ""Can something go wrong with my brain due to the illness?"". They say No, of course. But I felt something is wrong, and I start to have a panic attacks.  I can't go any more to the U-Bahn (metro), and big shops & malls, I can't even stay with other people in a room, cuz I felt anxiety and had a bad thoughts. I talking with a therapist for 3 months now, but I I have only a temporary improvement. I don't drink any pills yet. My life changed so much after this, I am scared if I get crazy.

                            ","Hello all,  my Mom is 78 years old and caught Covid in late November at a senior rehab facility.  It took about 2-3 weeks for her to ""recover.""

Before Covid my mom could walk 35 feet in her walker and do all her exercises etc.  She was due to come home and then caught Covid.

In December she seemed to loose almost all her strength.  At the end of December she could stand for a few minutes and transition from bed to a chair.  She came home around new years day.

She came home because of insurance reasons, otherwise I would still have her with skilled nursing.

It was obvious when she came home that Covid had wiped out her strength.  Unfortunately about a week after coming home, she had a** stroke and UTI**.  She was in the hospital for about a week and then she came home again.  While visiting her in the hospital, I of course contacted Covid.  I had a nasty time of it, where the monoclonal antibodies really helped.  In the meantime, for the two weeks that I was really sick, I could only help my mom with a few things like food & meds.  Since coming home from the stroke she has been bedridden.

So here's my question - she is currently bedridden and I am wondering what kind of recovery is possible?  When do people typically get their strength back?

*I've heard of people taking months to recover*  I think the combination of **covid + stroke** has done a number on her, however she is alive (count blessings) and she is mostly still there mentally though a little slow.  I have tried doing exercises with her - bed exercises - and while she can do it, it totally wipes her out.

If you have been through anything like this, please let me know.  Any comments appreciated.

Thanks,
Rob

PS - I have her on protein smoothies to get her strength back.  She is currently taking these supps:
1. Multi vitamin
2. D3
3. Fish Oil
4. cranberry concentrate - for UTI
5. womens probiotic (she also has an antibiotic for UTI)
6. zinc

On NY Day took a turn for the worse and was rushed into A & E by ambulance as I had pain in stomach, back, high temp and was being sick, breathing was shallow.
Long story short, temp went over 41, needed oxygen and steroids. Luckily even though there was talk of ICU I didn't need and came out after 6 days - although I am still quite poorly.
Since then I have good and bad days like most, but yesterday my mood was terribly low, so much so I couldn't stop crying (which is unlike me), and felt really depressed. I look very pale and now have the rash and spots everywhere.

Yesterday, i made the stupid and impulsive decision to attend a party with about 7 people, all who the host said had tested negative. none were exhibiting any symptoms so I feel like the chance i got it was very small, as I've unknowingly been around asymptomatic ppl before and didn't contract it.  in addition to this, i was only there for about 10 minutes. still regret going as now I'm considering isolation just in case, as my friends would be really p****d off if i gave it to them. Should I isolate? Or am I being paranoid?"

                            ","Seen as most people with symptoms don’t self-isolate and super-spreaders are going to carry on regardless without a care. Is there an alternative way in which Covid-19 can be stopped..? 

The biggest problem with isolating once you have the symptoms is that it’s too late; the virus has been passed on already in the several days previous when there were no symptoms. If only we knew from day 1 when people got infected rather than several days later. 

Maybe the answer is **separation** and not isolation? 
i.e. separate the people who won't keep their distance/wash their hands from those who will. The former group (the pro-covid group) are probably going to get it anyway. So let them get it in a controlled way and they can separate themselves from others before they catch it. This will stop super-spreaders.

What if shops, pubs, other small businesses and people were to identify themselves as ‘pro-covid’ or ‘anti-covid’. So people who have Covid or who don’t believe in taking precautions would be classed as ‘pro-covid’ and can shop, eat, drink at specific places (or times) as long as they wear an identifiable pro-covid marker like a lanyard so that ‘anti-covid’ people and vulnerable people who want to take precautions and wash their hands know who they are and can keep their distance. The problem is not everyone believes in exercising caution or distancing and you can’t force them to. These people will probably catch it anyway so let them catch it, but rather than allowing them to be a super-spreader and passing it on unknowingly to vulnerable people in public, let them 'shop and spread' in a controlled environment. Whether that be in designated areas or specific times of the day. So people who want to be safe will be safer and people who believe in freedom and want to take their chances can do so. 

A good example would be to use students who can isolate in halls with like-minded people - because a certain percentage of them are going to mix anyway so identify the ones who are going to mingle anyway and let them socialise in their pro-covid bubble where they can catch it at the same time. This will give them and others they come into contact with in the future greater protection from greater immunity. A certain percentage may catch it again, but what percentage is this? Less than 5%? Surely that’s a good trade off. It will also allow others who are vulnerable or who fully intend to stick to the rules can fully separate themselves from the other spreaders. This is the only way to limit the spread! And it needn’t be for a long time, just a 2 week trial. At the very least it should be piloted in one area. Such as a university, where they are not interacting with others who do not have covid. 

Even if just 1 young healthy person in a thousand were to become seriously ill from getting covid after such an experiment - they would have prevented the spread from infecting a further 3 to 4 thousand people! (because the ‘R’ value in people who don’t believe in social distancing is probably over 3 or 4 compared to 0.5 or less in the ones who do.

I've been working at a customers house that they have been renovating for the past couple of months. they moved out and went to live with one of their parents. I went there Tuesday night just to finish off some bits ( probably shouldn't of but they're about to have another baby and I wanted to complete before they moved back in) and one of them where in the home while I finished up. we passed a few times and had a chat probably no more than 5-10mins. I was there within the home for around 2hrs.

so the next day I receive a text off the customers saying that their dad who they have been living with for the last couple of months had been tested positive for covid that morning. The person who i had been in contact with is showing no symptoms but he has obviously been living with his dad long enough to surely pick up the virus. 

I really don't know what to do. would I have been exposed for long enough to contract covid. or was he not contagious because he was showing no symptoms. Should I try and get a test some how?

if anyone has had this or has some information on anything close I would much appreciate it.
many thanks."

The smells familiar to me have become completely different, having nothing to do with reality. I can't imagine my life without coffee, but coffee is now not at all the favorite drink that was before the illness. To be honest, it is very difficult for me to convey in words what I am experiencing, many do not understand how it is. Now a lot has changed for me, I start to forget the usual smells and tastes. When measured as a percentage, I can smell only 5 to 10% of smells and tastes. Sometimes I feel phantom smells, I used to wake up in the middle of the night from the smell of pomegranates, tangerines.

My church only has masses at 33% capacity and they are good about sanitizing the church after every mass. We maintain social distance (only every other pew is occupied with people well spread out and ushers will seat you) and wear masks, and all that. This morning I was seated 2 pews behind a family with 3 girls, looked like between ages of 8 and 14/15. They were all wearing masks but the middle girl (about 12 or 13?) was wearing it with her nose exposed the whole time. She was the only one not wearing it properly and neither of her parents seemed to care. She kept turning to her mother every minute or so and went to speak to her a couple of times, actually pulling the mask away from her mouth briefly as she did so. I couldn't believe it. I wanted to alert the ushers but they seemed oblivious and were too far away for me to get their attention.

Granted I have no idea if this girl is carrying covid. She didn't seem to look ill (she let out a tiny cough at one point but that was it) but the thing that worries me the most is asymptomatic spread and that you just don't know. She might even not know if she's carrying it (if she actually was). I was a fair distance away, not directly behind her (I'd say they were at least 10 feet in front of me and she was seated diagonally to my left). I was wearing an N95 mask that fit properly but I keep hearing how even they aren't enough to protect you.

I've got enough anxiety at the moment due to PMS (plus I'm a germophobe) so this is making it worse. Is there an extremely good chance I could have been exposed and infected? I'm very worried and thinking I can only rest easy until around the 17th or so if I haven't shown symptoms by then. I'm proactive, taking 1000mg of vitamin C a day as well as vitamin D, Zinc and Quercetin but I hope it's enough in case I was exposed. I'm even more worried because I heard about two guys around my age who recently died from it."

Five family members live together in another home 20 miles away. They all tested positive for COVID last month. My mother was admitted to the hospital for two weeks and is still struggling to fully recover back at their home.

They want us to visit on Christmas day, but I'm not sure if it would be safe. They are all now symptom free and will get tested again to make sure they are no longer infected.

I have diabetes, hypertension and heart failure, so I'm trying to be very cautious.

Have they built up antibodies at all? Could they become re-infected this soon and be able to pass it on to us?

I apologize if this seems like a stupid question, or if this is the wrong place to post it.

He gave me antibiotics as suspected a sinus infection but I am not so sure!  I am on day 5 (Amox/Clav) and the fever is not breaking nor the headaches and burning eyes.   He didn't push being tested for COVID but now thinking I may have to do that.

Let me also ad I have NOT lost my taste or smell.  No cough or respiratory issues to speak of.  

I know everyone deals with COVID different but have ANY of you had issues with a low grade fever that just goes up and down like a rollercoaster, burning eyes and headaches at times?

I had all my blood work done and the only thing off was my cholesterol  (total 277 but my LDL was 177), blood sugar was 100 but I didn't really fast either AND my vitamin B-12 was 1400 (elevated) so I knocked off on the daily supplements that I thought would give me some energy!

Everything else (labs) are perfect and I don't feel icky accept in my head with this dang fever!

I would so appreciate to here if anybody else has experience this as I don't know what it would be and getting scared!  It's all I think about and it's Christmas.  Even with a crappy year I want to enjoy it and can't :("

I have received a letter from authorities telling me I will have to have an 'mRNA vaccine'.

I am a 65 year old male in generally good health and live in the UK.

I'm in the 5th Category (according to UK organisers) to get the vaccine.  They only have the Pfizer one just now with 'emergency approval' and are currently vaccinating people with it.  I fear by the time they get round to me  - say, February / March - that I may well get the AstraZeneca/Oxford one.  I know I will need a mRNA shot to fulfil the authorities' request.  (I assume this is because of the questions raised by the AstraZeneca trials - which is certainly fair - most definitely for someone my age because only 12% of people my age were involved in their trial - only 4% over 70.  I'm praying they just may make it - i.e., the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine - for under 55's. )

In any case I will need to get an mNRA vaccine - with which I'm fine with.  My question - which I can't seem to get anyone to answer - at least so far -  is this:

If I was to get the initial AstraZeneca (Vector) vaccine ... could I still have an mRNA one (say either Pfizer or Moderna)???  Would it be safe to do so?  Or are you restricted to one kind of format once you've had it originally???  Any one know how long should be between the two shots?  I'm thinking about three months - as that is the minimum length that theyseem to think those who have endured Covid have substantial antibodies following - or so I've read.

Any advice you can offer me in terms of this will be HUGELY appreciated.  I have been pondering this for days.

                            ","Hello,

i thought id outline my experience with the virus to both vent my own frustrations and to get to know if others have been the same.

I tested positive for CoronaVirus back at the start of October, prior to this i wasn't the healthiest person with a weight of 18.5 stone and no physical work outs, most sat between a computer and bed. I started with a fever which lasted 2 days and a small cough, i took and test and found out i had covid. The fever didnt get worse, but i did start to feel faint, and often began to have a few panic attacks when i felt i couldnt catch my breath, but i kept myself isolated away from my family. I then lost my sense of taste and smell after 3 days. All in all during having covid i was okay, other than the odd need to lie down and take some deep breaths on occasion i was doing my normal routine. 14 days later all of my symptoms where gone and i ordered a new test, this came back negative.

O how i wish to be back in those days as from here it only gets worse.

For the next few weeks i suffered with tiredness, shortness of breath awful chest pain, and an uncomfortable throat, not sore just not right. i used paracetamol daily, and was advice by my GP to use anti inflammatory over the counter medicine for my throat if i felt it was swollen. I used Ice packs and hot water bottles on my chest which really seemed to calm me down and easy the pain. By this point we are on week 4 and my shortness of breath just seems to be getting worse, i speak to my GP as ive been having stomach problems, constipation for a few days at a time with barely any bowl movement. I was prescribed a brown inhaler and advised on some over the counter laxatives to try to help. The brown inhaler does the trick for a little while and i feel i can take deep breaths again, the laxitive seems to give me some relief, but only a bowl movement every 2 days and its often diharea. I keep on like this for a week or so before i start to feel short on breath again, my aunty allows me to use her unopened spare blue inhaler and my GP lets me go for blood tests, they also then prescribe me a blue inhaler. The blood tests show high levels of dead red blood cells in my liver function, that they arnt too concerned about, and i am sent on my way for blood tests in 2 weeks time. About a week later my chest started to sound like their was fluid in there and i had an abnormal heart beat occuring so i went to A+E, they did blood work, a scan of the chest, blood preasure and oxygen levels and told me they can seem to find anything at risk and that im 'fit and healthy to go'. 

That was week 8 and all of last week i felt so bad, chest aches, pains in my arm pits when i lay or move certain ways, breathless, and a weight on my chest. I phoned my GP on thursday to discuss getting a new brown inhaler as mine seemed yo not work as it used to, after discussing how i was feeling she gave me a 5 day course of steroid tablets and a x-ray to be done at my local hostpital between 9:30 nd 4:30 any week day. I take my first round of tablets and my chest feels so relieved, but the strange slow covered heart beat is still there and keeps me on edge, i have my x-ray and come home to a call from my GP about my second blood tests and the ones from A+E, they say my liver function tests are still a bit abnormal and that i have a high count of redblood cells, to which they can wait 3 momths and see of its covid after effects or organise an untralsound, i opt for the later and await the hospital to mail. I explain my heart/lung feeling to the GP and he prescribes me  a 5 day course of antibiotics to take with my 5 day steroid tablets.

Day 1 felt good, things seemed okay, day 2 was a bit achey but once again okay and towards the night i felt like a new man. Day 3 was worse, tight chest most of the day, aches and pains, shortness of breath, and my neck just started to feel so stiff and clogged. Im on day 4 today and once again my chest is so heavy, my breathing feels shallow but i can take deep breaths on occassion, and i have 1 day left to pray i feel better before the course is complete. I still but far less frequently feel the odd heart beat and lung feeling, but my chest feels like a pair of hands is pushing on the top of my pecks no matter how i try to sit or lay.

All in all thats my story so far, week 9 begins today, im constantly scared to sleep and not wake up, or to wake up and be in more pain or have more issues. I just want to have 1 day of normal. I cant even do the things i used to enjoy like sit at a computer and talk with friends or play games, because i just feel so closed in and tight and on edge, last night i had a mild panic attack from just sitting there for 2 hours feeling breathless.

is there anyone that can relate or feels the same?

My medical background is no allergies, i had asthma as a child when i was 7 or 8 but im now 28, 29 in december, and i am above typical bmi.

She wants to come over and see our son, but this is causing a rift in our marriage because I want them to come see my son. My wife is a RN BSN and she's adamant that essentially we shouldn't ever allow my mother over if she's not going to wear a mask. I know it's not your place to be Dr. Phil. Just want to know if mask wearing and washing hands is safe enough or if we should just draw a line in the sand and say no if she refuses to wear one at work."

I've had initial headache 10 days ago. Last Saturday has low grade fever until Tuesday. Never had cough and since Tuesday no fever. Yesterday did some tests and :
- white cells and lymphocytes normal 
- elevated crp, 21
- elevated d dimer, 1550
- elevated fibrinogen, 730

X Ray of chest showed no problems with alveola, just some ""emphasis"" in tracea and bronchi. 

My doctor panicked and prescribed:
- two IV antibiotics 
- Heparin 
- dexamethasone IV

Talked to another doctor and he said it's bull. Maybe heparin, but it's not really neccesary. 
A third one said xarelto is enough and 4mg dexamethasone. 

My self assessment is that on Thursday and Friday, I was feeling weak in the afternoon, which means the body was fighting hard. On Saturday it's to be expected than inflammation markers are high, but the body is fighting well and no need to do anything.

i don't know where to post this as google doesn't find any coronavirus forums, because news etc. take priority. I tried face mask, that blue type, which medical personal wears. There is huge space between nose and my face like 3cm+. I also found one, which has nano fiber - developed my local university. And it was almost too small and again: there is gigantic space between nose and face. It makes sense, because strings behind your ear on which holds face mask on your face, pull it outwards from your face, because nose.

I had respirator, which had this solved, but it teared: while i  gently stretched it... It was some russian crap, i didn't buy it tbh... But what concerns respirators... you can't breath in that, that's the problem. So i really need some good face mask. Problem is on many of these sites, they don't even list size. And even if they had like l, or xl. Common it is laughable, all people have different faces. Chances that they will fit are miniscule. Also majority is overpriced for one use, it would ruin me: trying to find a fit and than buy it frequently afterwards. And i am not even poor, or anything... IF there is even face mask, which doesn't have space between your nose. But coronavirus, is like microscopic particle, or smaller. 3cm is joke, i am not expert, but isn't it completely useless?  

It is really strange, that is 2020 and people can't even make face mask, which would be wearable... I am questioning my reality now..."

He got tested positive for covid and was kept in the hospital for a week  where he  got better, then we had to take him home because he made a huge fuss since he hates hospitals and feels very uncomfortable staying there. Doc said his oxygen level drops without an oxygen mask, so after much effort , we got him an oxygen concentrator. 1 week later, he has no fever and probably no other symptoms except for shortness of breath and low oxygen level. At first, he could stay 1 hour+ until his oxygen level drops to 80s, but now he's always on the concentrator.

It doesn't feel like a usual sore throat and it doesn't get worse when I swallow or anything. I went for a walk around 13 days ago and had a takeaway food a week ago. 

I have no other symptoms but the fact that I sometimes cough on purpose to try to relieve the itchy, scratchy throat. and my cough seems wet. Nothing seems to be relieving the soreness either which isn't that bad but it is bothering.

Should I be worried?

My concern is the roll, in which the smartphone Bluetooth is applied.
I understand that if you become within 2mts  of a registered positive
tested person , who has put there information into the NHS app it will
then pair up with another phone which in turn will tell that person that they
have been in contact with a positive tested person. Problem I see is that
people may have to self isolate, on the phones information. There may
be no proof that these two phone owners have actually had physical or
biological contact. There might be an eight foot high garden fence between
them.  The average range on a Bluetooth device is 10mts so what's to prevent
that the Bluetooth pairing is done at 6mts

                            ","Hi, 

So went out in Aberdeen on Saturday night just past for a few drinks. Both pubs I was in was sat a t a separate table from anyone else. I then joined a couple of friends when they came in. I checked with staff if this was OK as didn't want to just join in case that wasn't aloud. But she was happy about it.  The table I was sat at my friend's was smaller but we were all sitting back in our chairs so it didn't mean we were all hunched over the table. We then moved on to a another pub but there was a bit of a wait to get in. Hardly any social distancing in place nobody listening to security at all. I then decided to leave as I wasn't comfortable in that situation. In hindsight I shouldn't of gone out. But now I'm scared I've put my whole family at risk. Or it's all in my head. I don't have any symptoms just now and I do use a vaporiser so I do tend to cough now and again. Has anyone else had thoughts like this. I've also managed to get a home test sent out as I want to make sure. "

I am worried if I was exposed to Covid or these symptoms are because of covid


Though I followed all good habits I suddenly had difficultly breathing. Today  I was not able to breath through nose as those turbunates were kind of blocked. 

I suspect it triggered my anxiety and I had episode of shortness of breath. I used Arbuterol ashtama spray and felt better.  I also regularly use antihistamines and steroid nasal spray. Not sure if its contributing to dry nose...


One more thing when I did take steam I realized magically that swelling reduced to certain extent and I am able to breath normally but chest or ribs are still paining little bit

I don't know what I expect from posting on here, I guess I just want to know that I'm not alone and it would be good to share our stories with each other. 
My husband (39) was struck down with it at the end of March. I (37) got it exactly a week later, early April. A couple of weeks later both my boys (2 & 4) suffered with mild symptoms. April was a hard month. 
We fought off the virus at home, we were never tested as they weren't testing unless you were seriously in need of hospital care. So there is the worry that we didn't have Covid, however we had almost all the symptoms at some point in April and we are living with the havoc is causes to your body and mind still today.

I have achey days where I can barely move. I still suffer with chest pains. Sharp in the front and the feeling that somebody is sat on my back. Early June I attempted some light exercise and was left with a crackly breath and horrendous chest pains. I went to A&E and luckily it wasn't lung clots, however its muscle damage/scarring in my lungs. I was informed like its no big deal and I should just rest for 3-6 months. This is a big deal to an active person like myself who relies heavily on exercise to help my mental health too!
I suffer with headaches that put me in bed for a few hours due to the dizziness/nausea they cause. 
I also don't have a great digestive system anymore. 

My Husband has the dizziness/nausea/headache symptoms come back every fortnight that put him in bed for a day or two. This has also caused issues with his digestive system. 

My little 2 year old has had a recurring cough for weeks and weeks. I worry. I try not to but this is so concerning. The doctors aren't concerned because he is well in himself and there are no signs of an infection. This is sad that its now deemed ok for him to suffer with a bad cough for so long. 

What I'm starting to get annoyed over is the media's focus being solely on the survival rate. We are survivors yet our health is severely affected. People are going about their lives thinking this won't affect them because they're young and healthy and it will. There are even articles written on asymptomatic people who show lung issues.

I am so angry this has happened to us and scared about what this means for my children's health in the future. As somebody who already was affected by anxiety on a daily basis I am concerned over my growing obsession with this and what it is also doing to my mental health. 

We are taking Vitamin D and eating healthy, as we were before Covid. We are no longer exercising as much. I don't know what else I can do to help my family going forward. 

Thank you for listening. "

I got rested 6 weeks after Covid and last week had my antibody test at work which showed I have the antibodies. I'm just concerned why I still have a few symptoms after 3 months? Does anybody else?

many thanks

Even tho I wear a mask 24/7 and try to keep a distance from crowds as much as possible, these 2-3 days I started getting some extreme fatigue cases where at some moments of the day I feel so fatigued that I couldn't even move to the kitchen for example. Before the Corona out-brake I used to walk for a lot of kilometres a day, now after months in isolation I feel like I cant go to  the supermarket and not get tired.

(I would like to point out that Im a smoker)

I don't have a high Temperature,nor Coughing nor Sore Throat but I have this feeling of being able to breath a lot Easier (?) than I could before, and that seems strange to me because this has never occured to me before.

I also have sudden wakes up early in early hours such as 5AM and such (Just the time that im writing this forum discussion) .  

Could I be an A-Symptomatical case?  Or its just Spring fever that occurs regularly..


All best,

-Kristijan

I identifies so much with so many of your testimonies, that I took that to mean that I too was experiencing a freak prolonged covid episode. Like most of you, I was very sick. Throughout I was terrified, not only of my own sickness, but of my friends and family, and the that of the crumbling world around me. I researched and read every article out there on symptoms, pandemic management, contagion etc. I also read up way too many healthcare pages and self diagnosed all sorts of whacky symptoms and side effects. I tried asthma and allergy medication,  I tried steroids, abx, the works... I had cat scans, x rays and blood tests, Mr saw at least 3 doctors. Nothing was wrong with me. No with my body at least...
I had a flu, maybe even covid, but that didn't  last longer than a couple of weeks. my cough and tiredness must have lingered a bit, but the disease was gone. What happened to me, and I'm sure to most of you out there, is that at some point in our worries we transitioned from a physical illness to an anxiety disorder, and this requires a diametrically opposed treatment to what we're doing. I could not believe anxiety could cause such physical symptoms, but believe me when I say it can. Myalgia, burning sensation, chest tightness, GI symptoms... I suffered from all of these things excruciatingly. 

Please, if you're out there and feel like you've had covid symptoms for more than a month, it's time to put down you computer, phone and tablet, rest, relax, meditate, see a mental health professional, and finally embark on the road to recovery. I'm on my way there after over 2 months.

Godspeed and good luck!"

We have two separate bathrooms, separate bedrooms, etc., but only one kitchen.  Do you think this would help minimize the spread of germs? My thinking is that my husband and I wash our hands really well, we have been quarantining in our home, etc. We do not know if the individuals at my spouse's ex's house are quarantining or practicing safety measures. We know that they have taken at least one trip out of town, and my step-daughters tell me that their mother has told them not to wash their hands because it makes their skin dry.  In the kitchen, we have a fridge, several counters, many drawers, a hutch with snacks, a pantry and storage area with snacks, two sinks, etc. There are over 200 touch surfaces, so I just thought that by only allowing the two adults get food for everyone, we would potentially be minimizing the spread of germs from one house to another.

Apologies for starting a separate thread on this. I am really suffering from very annoying insomnia due to Covid (suspected) and was wondering if anyone is keen to share their experience? It seems a lot of us are having problems sleeping. 

Week 2-3: Terrible. Some nights of complete no sleep.
Week 4-12: Fragmented 5-7 hours. Waking up every hour or two. There were only a handful of nights that I could get 3-4 hours in a row. Sometimes I wake up and find myself over-breathing.
Week 13-14: Gone backwards again. 3-4 hours on average per night.

The problem is staying asleep, rather than falling asleep. I'm using melotanin, also valeriaan and CBD. None seems to really keep me asleep.

How has your experience been? Anything that helped?

The theory is that this is to do with your vagus nerve. In the process of fighting off the virus it is a bit messed up and may take a long time to heal and reset itself.

Many thanks"

I'm now into my 11th week of illness. I've never had a test for covid but am still struggling with breathlessness. I spoke to my doctor again today and this is what he told me, I'm sure many of you will find this reassuring.
I was beginning to worry that it wasn't covid and if not what the hell was it, but he said he speaks to patients every day with the same symptoms as many of us on here who have been also suffering for many weeks and some of these have had positive tests for  covid and is very certain that's what I've had.
He also said the reason I'm struggling is to do with the alveoli in the lungs. He said they are not getting the oxygen to the body properly which is why your chest sounds clear but you can't breathe. He was very insistent about this. 
This article helps explain it:
https://health.clevelandclinic.org/heres-the-damage-coronavirus-covid-19-can-do-to-your-lungs/
He also said the antibody tests are not great and to just take it that it is covid I've had. He said to carry on with what I've been doing ; walking gently when I can. He also said other patients symptoms are also up and down just like mine and proof of my o2 stats fluctuating is proof it's my alveoli not working properly (I have a fitness tracker which also measures o2).
I hope this helps to put your mind at rest like it did with me and make you realise we are not going mad or dying of something else! He said it is going to take time to improve. "

I was really surprised that the fever had come back so I sent off another test which came back negative again I phoned my GP to say that I had concerns if this wasn’t COVID-19 there must be something wrong with me my kind GP for me they were for such things as fevers before COVID-19 and to continue taking paracetamol every day I’m 65 and it’s my birthday next Wednesday I do have heart disease and I am slightly overweight and suffer from asthma apart from the fever I’ve had muscle pain on my legs mainly around the shins and headaches. very difficult to gauge COVID-19 as the doctors don’t know much about it nor do I it is strange how some days I feel quite well and then the fever just kicks in and I have to go to bed I’m surprised  I hear that some people are given antibiotics my GP has categorically said this is a virus antibiotics will not work thankfully the paracetamol are keeping things at bay I haven’t got a thermometer so I I don’t know what my temperature is quite often I have to have a water bottle and now I feel I meant on fire inside my body I’m quite cool on the outside.

My brother works in the waste disposal industry and his wife cleans at a (currently COVID free) smaller nursing home.  Both my brother and his wife have regular tests for the virus, all having showed up as negative so far.  They get the results 3 days after attending the test.

The other weekend myself and my wife called around to see my parents unannounced and witnessed my brother and his wife inside, albeit at least 2 metres away, drinking tea/coffee prepared with my parents' crockery.  No PPE worn either.  My brother has the opposite attitude to risk avoidance to me and sees my stance as a overreaction.  He seems to have convinced our parents also of this.  They (correctly) see his wife as undertaking a heroic and crucial task in maintaining the cleanliness of the home in which she works, but then say they do no not want to banish her.

When I call around to do their cleaning, they always retire temporarily to their garden summer house and read / do crosswords etc.

When I call with my wife, we either stay in their garden or talk at the door.  My mum especially fusses and says ""come in and have a cup of tea"" - which we politely decline.  My parents have now been isolated in their suburban home for 10 weeks and have not ventured out.

I've sent the post shown below to several people as replies to their posts.   I hope I'm not over posting which I know can be irritating but I've had such success with the treatment method described below that I'm on a real campaign to encourage Corona patients to try it.   Feedback would be great.  Anything from ""nope, didn't work for me to yes I'm healed"" would be appreciated.Pray we can beat this thing. 

I had flu symptoms coming on strong on March 25, 2020.  Not sure if it was Corona or just regular flu.   Anyway I immediately used a method I call my ""kill flu"" treatment which I've been using with 100% success for the past 20 years.   Just suggesting that you try it because it's been so successful for me.  Hoping it could be successful for you.   Very simple: A. Drink 3 glasses of very warm water (not hot enough to burn you but definitely very warm). B.  Use a hair blower on medium temperature to blow warm air onto your face for 30 minutes.   C.  Use deep breathing for the 30 minutes to repeatedly fill your lungs with warm air.  Also breathe in through your nose for awhile then through your mouth etc. trade back and forth.  D.  Do this 2 to three times a day for a couple of days.Hope this works for you.  

It literally changed my life  20 years ago.   I'm a retired teacher and when I first started teaching I would get quite sick multiple times with the flu each year from October to March.  Called in sick constantly during that time period each year.   Finally out of desperation and much research I came up with the method described above.  I had reached the point where I was considering quitting teaching.   First time I used this method I was back to normal in one day.   From that point on I never called in sick again due to the flu.   I've been reading so many stories of people suffering through Corona; it just tears at me. I’m  making this suggestion to as many as possible.   It definitely  worked for me on the flu (and possibly on Corona in March).   I really hope this method works for Corona patients.   Sincerely, Rowland Reeves"

A couple of days later and my chest started to feel raw and sore just assumed i had a virus ....probably covid.  My  chest started to burn constantly all day long the burning lasted 3.5 weeks. Then sharp pains felt like it was flipping from one side of my chest to the other, also felt like the burning went down to my tummy area. Shortness of breath begun day 7. Sometimes it was so bad I had to really concentrate on my breathing to catch my breath. Also my heart rate has been through the roof as soon as I move, walk a little it goes really high like I’m fast walking/jogging etc  145bpm feel dizzy. Week 2 started with the hot night sweats! Waking up like I’m on fire. Sweating awful Body odour-I don’t suffer with this normally.  Still having the hot sweats week 7... every night. Also had facial flushing and have had a temp on and off for 6 weeks. headaches and body aches  I was given antibiotics after 3 weeks Incase. I went to the hospital as the doctors said it couldn’t be covid as it was going on too long. I had a chest X-ray that was clear. Sent home. I wondered if the virus has caused some sort of gastric issues and that the burning is due to severe acid reflux. Something I’ve NEVER suffered from only when pregnant. I’m now on Omeprazole 40g for 2 weeks. The burning and pain in my back has eased. I’m now left with the some chest pains but the high heart rate upon walking around my house has not gone away nor has the acute breathlessness.

I believe I had Covid at the end of March, (symptoms were tight chest, breathing laboured, temperature and chills, fatigue, and a sore throat, which lasted initially for ten days, and then a week after feeling I was.recovered, I had a resurgence of my symptoms. 
Since then, I've noticed that I've started getting symtoms of a very runny nose and eyes streaming when I drink alcohol. i don't think it can be hay fever as I don't have those symptoms any other time.  At first I thought it was an intolerance I might have to cider, but having drank a glass of wine list night, and had the same problem.. I'm now thinking it might be all alcohol. This definitely wasn't happening before Covid.
I am having feelings of nausea most days, which I wonder if means the virus might still be lingering after reading others posts, although I did have a test a couple of weeks ago, and that was negative.
i would be interested to hear people's thoughts, and if they've noticed something similar?

Thanks

                            ","Hi all, been feeling unwell since yesterday morning. I just wanted to check if these sounded like coronavirus symptoms?

Yesterday morning both me and my partner woke up feeling very hot - we believe this is because we had a winter duvet on the bed and have no air flow or windows in the bedroom, and with the warmer weather, we think  we must have overheated a little. When I got up to go to the toilet, I felt really hot and a little light-headed, achy. I didn't want to touch my usual morning tea  as I felt queasy as well. I attempted to eat lunch, but only felt more nauseous after a couple bites. My boyfriend, although he felt hot and a little nauseous upon waking up, felt fine after an hour or two, and still is.

Early in the afternoon, I threw up. I felt better and relieved of my nausea for a little while until I started to feel achy, nauseous and feverish again. I was sick again shortly after. I had a couple of naps in the afternoon which made me feel better. By the end of the day I felt significantly better, only a little achy and a little hot. I never measured my temperature as I don't currently have a thermometer, but it felt that any potential fever was dwindling as I was no longer fidgeting or feeling any slight chills.

I slept well, only woke up with a slight headache and much lesser body aches, which have mostly gone as of now.  I no longer feel feverish or hot to touch, and have been able to eat and drink (just unable to do my usual quantities). I look a lot better today too. I would just like to say that I am not pregnant (haven't had sex since my last period), and I have had zero contact with the outside world since lockdown has begun. I am isolating with my boyfriend and his family at their home in a rural area. I only go out for walks. His parents have been doing the shopping as we are working from home full-time. They have been very careful in doing so and follow all the precautions.  I was going to consider being tested today if I still felt feverish, but I don't. Nobody believes I have it, but I am a hypochondriac so it still worries me. I have no other symptoms and feel far better today. Should I be concerned that this is covid? "

                            ","I live in New York on Long Island, which is still considered a hot spot. Our state's lockdown is supposed to start easing on Friday, but will probably take at least a few weeks longer for my region. 

I've got to make 3 visits to health care facilities next week and I'm very worried. Tuesday morning I have an appointment for a yearly mammogram/ultrasound. Another day (either Wed or Thurs, I haven't decided yet) I'm supposed to go to a lab to have blood work done for my yearly physical, which is on the 27th. And then Friday I have another yearly physical at my pulmonologist's office (was diagnosed with mild asthma when I was 12, though starting to wonder if I outgrew it as I no longer take daily medication for it and my symptoms have pretty much disappeared).

The thing that concerns me the most is exposure to a significant viral load. I'd read some good info not long ago that it's the viral load that does you in with this virus.. that going to the supermarket for a short time or being outside doesn't normally expose to you a great amount of the virus, but if you're in an indoor, enclosed setting for a greater period of time especially  with a large group of people, you could get exposed to a huge dose of it. I know hospitals carry the threat of a great amount of exposure (my uncle is currently hospitalized for non-covid-related kidney failure and they forbid us to visit him), and I'm wondering if it's that bad for doctors' offices and medical labs.

I did call the lab last week for info on precautions they're taking. They're having patients call them from their car in the parking lot and letting them know when to come up to the lab. They're also requiring them to wear masks (but not gloves, for some reason). That makes me feel a little better, but the radiology group where I'm having the mammogram done hadn't said anything when I called last month to reschedule (appt was originally on the 18th of April).  I'm also wondering if I should reschedule my pulmonologist appt. Like I said this is just a yearly follow-up, it's not an urgent appt.

I'm just very uncomfortable about being in this type of setting three days in a row with the danger of being exposed again with this area still being a hot spot. One of the offices (primary care doctor I think) said their health care workers get tested daily, but I'm concerned about coming into contact with other patients who may be asymptomatic and could infect me. I'm 42 and no underlying chronic conditions (save for the very mild asthma which again I suspect I've outgrown) but I hear about people around my age who the media say are ""otherwise healthy"" becoming critically ill. I haven't left my house since the beginning of March when I'd seen my primary care doctor for an upper respiratory infection. I've gone outside walking my dogs in the neighborhood and exercising in my back yard, but I haven't gone shopping or anything like that...other family members have done so over the past 2 months and thankfully they haven't been sick. But again I'm concerned about the environment of the doctors' offices. Any advice? Should I cancel all the appts or maybe just keep 1?

Thought I'll start a separate thread for this. I had a fever 10 weeks ago. The fever lasted 3 days but after the fever went I just simply struggled to sleep.

These days my sleeping is very poor, managing 4-7 hours on average of interrupted sleep. This is even with the help of melatonin.

I'm still fatigued and suffering some mild cold like symptoms after 10 weeks. 

My trouble with sleeping is not helped by my anxiety. Doctor found I was extremely low on Vitamin D so now I'm taking supplements. The lack of Vitamin D may also have contributed to my sleeping problems and slow recovery.

Just wondering if anyone has the same sleeping problem with confirmed or suspected Covid-19? How are you coping?

What I mean is sleeping problems as a symptom of the virus or as an after-effect of the virus, not due to worry or anxiety.

Many thanks"

Since the start of the Covid-19, there have been many debates around the wearing of the mask, the use of hydro-alcoholic gels and other barrier gestures to put in place, but nothing about the door handles, which are vectors of invisible bacteria. Whether it is individuals, businesses or the medical sector, we should consider installing secure, sanitized and non-contact hand grips so that the hands do not come into direct contact with the handles.
Instead of using your hand as usual, you should be able to use your forearm, and even more precisely your elbow, by setting up the equivalent of a hand-free handle. This would avoid permanent disinfection of our door handles or opening with disposable towels, problematic for the environment...

As there was no possibility of a test, I have no certainty but as a key worker out and about in the community I am pretty certain it was the Coronavirus.  

I still do not feel normal. I typically feel tired, although my daily walk and other physical activity do not seem to lead to real exhaustion.  I find that work-related Zoom Conferences often provoke an episode of stomach upset and nausea. I sometimes feel mildly 'fluey' , with a minimal but discernible sore throat. My muscles are twitching rather than aching (although this has been diminishing in recent days). I generally sleep through the night and my appetite is only a little diminished. But I'm not getting that morning burst of energy and am sleepy for much of the day. 

When the pandemic began, the advice was that people with mild symptoms were better after 14 days. So I wonder whether this is still the recovery period nearly two months on, whether it might be Post Viral Fatigue Syndrome or the beginning of something more long-term like CFS. Should I be trying to see my GP at this stage (if he will see me) or just keep going?

Had a fever 9 weeks ago which lasted 3 days, then 3 days or so of green/yellow phlegm and 4-5 weeks of white phlegm.

Throughout this whole time I've been fatigued and worst of all have significant trouble sleeping. When the sleep problem started around 8 weeks ago there were nights when I couldn't sleep at all.

Now I manage anywhere between 4-8 hours of sleep a night. The sleep is very interrupted and not very good quality. Often I would take up after 1-2 hours and struggle to fall back asleep.

I also seem to be suffering post viral fatigue. I can manage daily activities no problems even incorporating some exercise (bike rides etc....), but when I exert myself I sometimes get a slight sore throat and runny nose, typical post viral fatigue symptoms. It seems sleep disturbance is another post viral fatigue symptom.

I did a CRP test 2 weeks ago and the doctor confirmed that the infection is gone, and I'm just feeling the after effects.

Anyone else going the same thing or having trouble sleeping?

I started having panic attack, had to control my breath and chill myself down as I couldn't sleep the whole night worrying too much in the morning. So today is the 3rd/4th day, Idk if it is covid or something, but the fever keeps kicking in and out. I don't have other symptoms till now. It's just the fever mainly and feeling of tight chest  sometimes. Moreover, I was having nicotine withdrawal symptoms this morning and I felt like I was about to pass out. Everything all at once. But I have been eating well, stretch out from time to time and just trying to keep myself active. One thing is that, I used to get sick 2-3 times in 3-4 months, even before all this started and I usually get better after few days. I feel so confused and scared at the same time when thinking about this. I am glad I found this site to open up a bit and think positively ❤️. "

It started on my hand and worked its way in patches up my arm down my entire side, my stomach and my entire thigh and leg was completely covered with hives. My tongue swelled up and I thought it was just allergies, because I’ve never dealt with this before but I do have allergies. I have asthma, and I had trouble breathing for about a week. One day The hives completely went away and my breathing was back to normal. I went to urgent care and ask them if this had any connection with the coronavirus and she said no, but there was no medication for me besides Benadryl. Now I’m seeing that dermatologists are seeing a tie between COVID-19 and skin conditions. I also had symptoms of a lack of taste and it sort of felt like my mouth was burned as if I ate something hot the day before. Although I feel better now, could it have been COVID-19 after all?"
