0,High risk and just tested positive,https://covid19.camhx.ca/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=123,2022-06-06T16:34:45-04:00,Survey Girl,"
I'm high risk for severe covid and I just tested positive. I've gone this entire time without catching it and now I got it. I contacted it from someone at work. I'm on day 3 and I seem to be feeling worse everyday. I'm just curious what helped you through the symptoms and beating it? I'm completely stressed about what's going to happen.

Any advice on a primary school teacher testing positive? The school seems to be telling teachers that they must attend work if tested positive.

2,How do we move on?,https://covid19.camhx.ca/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=121,2022-04-13T13:33:30-04:00,Respiratory Therapist,"
I am a respiratory therapist who worked the front line the past 2 years. It's been incredibly challenging for me to go back to normal life. I've watched 100+ people die and suffer throughout the pandemic, feeling helpless. It felt like nothing we did saved them. Watching people come into the hospital and knowing they're going to be dead within the day or the week and having to pretend like everything is fine. Or watching someone die suffering in their last moments. With my job I am at by their heads, watching their faces, watching them struggle to breathe and suffer, before dying completely alone with usually just myself and maybe a nurse in the room. It's hard to make the mental switch to now ""okay covid is over let's get back to normal"" after all I've witnessed.It makes me feel like all of the lives lost are invalidated. How am I supposed to move on from this? How do I go back to normal life without forgetting all the people who've lost their lives?Does anyone else struggle with this issue? I feel like I'm the only one who can't let go.

I was positive for Covid over a year ago and suffer from a long list of I guess they are called ailments? Sometimes I feel like I am the only one out there. Am I crazy? Am I really this weak? I feel depressed, useless. Anyone else feel like me? Countless dr bills dr visits only to hear oh we’re sorry we just don’t know enough about post Covid to treat you.

I’m a 38 year old man; and throughout my life have been in contact with chicken pox on a yearly basis, I’ve never contracted it or had it. Now it seems I’m having the same reaction to covid, I’ve been exposed to so much of it, through work and home, my  family go down with highly contagious omicron and I don’t get it. My 9 year old son is exactly the same with chicken pox and covid the same as me. Does anyone else relate to this as I would love to know?

5,Got COVID positive after fully vaccinated - loss of taste/smell,https://covid19.camhx.ca/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=113,2021-05-03T09:24:45-04:00,Tony Pony,"
Hi,I was fully vaccinated about 3 months ago (pfizer) and have now caught covid.  The tracing of this has led to a friend of a friend of friend who went to a gathering in Toronto and brought it home with him.  So, I think it is the B117 strand since I did get symptoms and tested positive.My initial symptoms were low grade fever, never higher than 37.6C/99.8F.  I had a runny nose for about 1 day and a bit tired the next day with sinus pressure.  On the third day I lost my smell and especially taste.Any information on when I will regain smell/taste?  Anyone else gone through this AFTER already being vaccinated?

Hi, I am doing everything I can to keep safe but keep feeling anxious about whether my family members will get it, or whether I will get it and whether we will get a serious case and have to go to the hospital or if it will get even worse and one of us will die of it. I feel helpless even though we are all doing whatever we can to keep safe.

8,Loneliness during COVID,https://covid19.camhx.ca/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=110,2021-03-23T16:19:39-04:00,Dale H,"
Being alone is hard enough sometimes, but keeping busy has helped me coupe to some extent. Even though I may do some video conferencing and talk to some of my friends and family on the phone, Facebook at times is a cesspool of garbage at times and some express wants and needs or how they are feeling. I don't think this is helpful, although some of my friends are at least living with others. I still get loneliness feelings. I feel like no one really cares...but I know this is not true but my brain is getting caught up with the non-in person visiting. I love being around people, not necessarily those who I know either.  How are others feeling in this situation? Any suggestions as to how to curb this and feel better?

9,Feeling Abused by Expectations on LTC Managers &amp; Staff,https://covid19.camhx.ca/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=109,2021-02-08T10:02:41-05:00,Mustang Sally,"
I am becoming more and more frustrated by the expectations the Ministry of LTC, Ministry of Labour and Resident families are putting on the LTC worker.  We have been getting swabbed for testing once a week since November.  Staff come in on days off for no compensation now they are introducing rapid testing which will be 3 x a week yeah.  Our nasal passages will look like someone that has been abusing coke for years.  No other sector is subjected to these invasive test routinely.  I was one of the lucky staff to receive my initial vaccine but now it is day 31 with no word when next dose will come.  I always was taught to follow the drug companies guidelines when taking medication so find this ambiguity very frustrating.

Hi!I have had a few episodes of depression which at the moment is controlled. However, I had a rough day at work yesterday and feel the beginnings of saddness which can lead to depression if I'm not careful. I can usually handle the odd bad day as we all get them and it's part of being human but I'm wondering if because of all the other things going on, the pandemic, lack of fun time, haven't seen friends lately, if it's pushed me over the edge a bit....I feel so so tired and just want to be by myself....but maybe that's because I've been working more lately and am around people quite intensely with my job...I""m not sure if it's the depression or just normal needing down time. I also had my first covid test yesterday on my way out of work, It was quick and not too bad but a few minutes after on my way to my car I was seconds from passing out! I've feel a bit off since...and I didn't make it into work today...I am self employed luckily so I can switch days if I really have to...I feel pretty embarassed about that, thank god I made it to my car so no one saw me!!One of my major tools to help deal with depression has not  been available to me since March, it's a support group and it's the one thing that I really do miss:(

13,Just Reaching Out,https://covid19.camhx.ca/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=106,2020-10-19T12:04:31-04:00,John Doe,"
Hello,     I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder three years ago. I have taken part in the Dialectic Behavioral Therapy offered at my local CMHA about a year and a half ago. Besides struggling with BDP, I tend to struggle with Social Anxiety as well as Depression. To say the least, the pandemic has been a little overwhelming at times. Couple that with getting a new job in May of this year and I have been very anxious most days. One of the more ironic things about my employment is that I am working at my local CMHA so unfortunately, due to conflict of interest concerns I am not able to be treated there. I was referred to a different agency close to where I live, but I was not able to keep my appointments and my counselling just kinda fell off after a while. Around the same time I was also seeing a behavioral change counsellor about my substance abuse issues, but that also kinda just fell off at the start of the pandemic due to the counsellor I was seeing taking time off for personal safety reasons and neither one of us really following-up on things. Somewhat needless to say, things have been rough at times, I know I'm not the only one going through stuff, all of humanity is basically dealing with the issues related to the pandemic, so I don't want to come off as I think I am the only one or anything like that, but with my condition and circumstances, things can be pretty difficult for me. Due to the previously mentioned things as well as the fact that I live alone and can feel quite lonely at times, I wanted to make this post. Just to reach out and tell my story, or at least a part of it, as well as let anyone out there with similar things that your not alone. I know how empty those words can seem when your going through things, but from someone who knows that type of pain and hurt, I just want to say your not alone. I promise.

Hello, I am new here. I have an Autistic 21 year old son who likes to go the Malls and Parks and I am seeking a good mask for him. My research is showing that N95 masks are the safest but they are not reusable or washable. The 2nd best are Surgical masks but these are disposable. So both options would be expensive.Can anyone recommend a reusable/washable mask which would suffice or would it be best to go with one of the above mentioned please? Thank you.

15,Friend problem,https://covid19.camhx.ca/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=93,2020-05-08T12:17:29-04:00,Catness 45,"
I have a friend who I recently reconnected with after a few years. Now she is into all of the COVID conspiracy theories and is very anti-government. She went to the COVID protest at Queen's Park, even though it was a 4 hour drive. I'm finding her ideas to not be helpful to my mental health. I don't know how to, in a healthy way, create some space between us, at least until this is over. Any suggestions? She wants to Skype and sends me articles. It's not like there's much else to talk about right now if we were to Skype; I don't think I could not talk about COVID. This friendship is creating quite a bit of stress for me. We used to be best friends so I don't want to exclude her from my life permanently.

18,Is anyone perfect when it comes to physical distancing?,https://covid19.camhx.ca/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=100,2020-06-02T15:52:05-04:00,Guitar Girl,"
Hello,While I know that we all need to practice physical distancing at all times, I'm having trouble doing it perfectly.  I live on a street which is tiny and cramped and has kids on it.  When I walk out my door, there are my neighbours 10 feet away on their own property.  I love all my neighbours.  I have a kid too and our kids play together--not all day but sometimes on weekends.  They ride bikes, play hockey or soccer on the street and are trying to stay 6 feet away from each other but it's not perfect.  The only way to do this perfectly would be to yank my kid inside the house each time someone else comes out.   I have taken my kid to the park etc. but there are always more kids at the park than on my street. Plus, kids at the park are all strangers, not like the bubble of 4 families of neighbours who all know each other.  They say it takes a village to raise a child and my little street is a village.  I find that taking my kid to the park comes with more risks than letting them play on the street where everyone is known to them.So, I'm not a perfect physical distancer but am doing my best.  But if there are other insights or advice that people have, I would like to hear it. Thanks.

19,Harm Reduction Kits? Addiction Support?,https://covid19.camhx.ca/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=99,2020-06-02T15:26:05-04:00,insom 96,"
I'm finding it difficult to figure out what kind of services are available and what aren't for people with addiction. I've seen online news reports from Hamilton saying many of their harm reduction services are closed and I'm wondering what's available in Toronto?

I can't find stuff on their website about changes in their programs other than the fact that things are moving online more. Anyone know where I can find this kind of information without having to call every program/org I come across?

I have been thinking about going back on medication, but I don't know where to start or how to ask my doctor as i am not fully comfortable with him. Any advice would be great about asking for help and getting back on medication. thanks

I am a seasoned expert in the above techniques and I would love to share my education, experience and knowledge. I am both a ""survivor"" of two major mental health crises and a trained health professional in meditation, mindfulness and stress reduction.As well as sharing my knowledge, I am always interested in learning new things! So let's keep the dialogue in this area alive ;-)Here are a few things you can do RIGHT NOW to help you relax:1, Backwards counting from 50 with your breath: Start at 50 INHALE; EXHALE at 49; INHALE at 48; EXHALE at 47 and so on. If you forget what number you were at or reach 0 and are still not relaxed - simply restart at 50. I use this to help me drift off into sleep quite often.2. TAKE 5: INHALE for 5 seconds (say the word 'steamboat' silently in your head for each full second if you don't have a watch) THEN - EXHALE for 5 seconds. Repeat 5xs through. When you get good at this you can try holding the breath for 5 seconds in between - BUT please be seated or laying down for this as holding the breath may cause dizziness.

I think during this pandemic my cravings have grown to increasingly unbearably painful to manage because I’m stuck in my house trapped in my own thoughts. Thinking about past traumas have been all that’s flowing through my mind and since getting clean I’ve been finding it harder to cope with the fact that im kind of losing my sense reality because I want to find a way out of feeling the way I do. But since losing my counsellor it’s been difficult reaching out to a someone new because of my abandonment issues and the feeling of being scared that if I talk to someone new that they’ll just leave me too. That thought stems from being in the foster system for my whole youth and losing a lot of people in my life whether it’s through death like my biological parents or losing a friend because they’ve grown tired of hearing the same thing from me with having constant problems and now having no one I’ve just felt alone.

Found out recently I'm at a higher risk of infection because of my medication. It's only every 6 months and the highest risk times are the days/weeks following a dose. Unfortunately my next dose is this week and my fear has gone through the roof.Having to commute to a clinic (thankfully not being done at the hospital) and sit through the administration of the medication which takes 5-6 hours and makes me feel exhausted and just crappy only to have to commute home, knowing my immune system was just partially obliterated and then waiting for a few weeks through the usual discomfort it causes hoping I didn't catch anything has had me completely wound up.Made worse by the fact that I need to go to downtown Toronto, to a hospital, to get a test done, a week after i get this medication given, I'll still be elevated risk and coping with the associated fear of the given circumstance is feeling overwhelming.

Given the current situation, globally, we certainly are not alone regarding a disconnect from what was the norm not very long ago. However, for me, I've taken the opportunity to ""Look"" deeply within without any judgment whatsoever and to also appreciate what is right, like the sun, the rain, a blue sky, the clouds, flowers starting to grow, listening to sounds of nature, going for walks, reading a book etc. For many people they may in fact find it difficult doing ""No-thing"" , however, doing nothing is its own meditation and in fact is ""Effortless"". Riding the wave of life embracing it with all of our senses can invoke a real sense of freedom from what might have been the ""Norm"". This can be a time for reframing how we think and feel and improving lifestyles, taking breaks from information overload, and being present to what really matters. This could be a time for Clarity in our lives about what we actually need versus the things we may want. One thing for sure, many feelings and emotions are similarly felt regardless of what part of the Globe you reside we can all relate to Love, Support, Compassion etc.

We, as most people, are trying to stay home as much as possible and have not had any visitors since all this began, nor have we gone to visit anyone.

Multiple people in a very small apartment. An apartment that the heating system is shared with our apartment (meaning we get to share the same air as a bunch of strangers). Has anyone else had neighbours abusing/violating social distancing?

33,Staying Positive,https://covid19.camhx.ca/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=83,2020-04-23T11:21:19-04:00,n u,"
I think for a lot of people 2020 was supposed to be the year where everything changed for the better. It was supposed to be a year filled with new experiences, momentous changes and achieving lifelong goals. For me personally, I had this notion in mind that this would be the year where all the plans I laid out would come to fruition through diligence and honing in on the infinite potential that lies within. Then COVID 19 happened. It was an entirely unexpected, unpredictable left turn. Suddenly. all the strategies I had been working on to push my dreams into reality had to be reassessed, if not, put on the back-burner entirely. But even beyond that I knew that so many people around the world have been suffering indescribable losses far beyond my comprehension due to this pandemic. In a way this  can be felt in the air around us. As I've been attempting to adjust to this new routine, there have been ups and downs. An understanding that has helped me stay positive through all of this is realizing that sometimes the medicine that we need to heal us is often bitter. I think that being in isolation is forcing a lot of people to slow down and reassess their own priorities. In my case, it helped me stop and really strengthen my intentions as well as add more details to the goals that I had been visualizing. I only now understand how important this step is in my journey. If I look back at life, I know, beyond a doubt, that the most difficult experiences in my life became the catalyst through which I grew and changed for the better. I find solace in this awareness. Another mental exercise that has helped me is practicing mindfulness. Just last night, I watched a lecture which said that mindfulness is not just breathing or meditating but it is the simple act of being present... entirely present. By this, it means to not focus on the future or the past but to simply soak in where you are right now. If you are eating a piece of fruit for instance, its to notice the fruits sweetness or the fact that you have a chair to sit in and a house that is warm. Perhaps its noticing that the room is quiet and you have time to think. This has deepened my sense of gratitude for the incalculable blessings that exist everywhere. I've also tried to take my previous goals and create micro-goals that I am actually able to work on while in self-isolation. These are just a few thing that have helped me. I hope everyone is staying safe and truly we are all in this together.

Hi,Although my husband is currently working from home and has set up an excellent office for himself in the basement, his boss has been pressuring him to work from the office. My husband’s team member was recently let go so he is in charge of training the new hire, which he is currently doing through phone calls, Skype and screen sharing. His boss believes that the new hire can be trained more efficiently in person, while still maintaining social distancing. My husband has repeatedly tried to explain to his boss that he doesn’t feel safe going into the office and would rather train at home. The new hire feels the same way. Furthermore, in person training would still result in screen sharing since they would be sitting far apart. My husband is feeling immense pressure as he is trying to balance training his co-worker and getting his own work done at a rate that is sufficient for his boss. On the other hand, if he goes into the office, he would only be putting his health and other people’s health at risk. For now his boss let him work from home this week, but will decide the outcome of next week based on his performance.How should he go about dealing with this situation?

Why do I feel more anxious about going to the grocery store than I do about going to work.... I'd rather be at the hospital working those frontlines than going to the grocery store. Also how can some essential places still be open without providing PPE to them.. do employers know this is now community spread.

I realize this is a hard time...it's a lot for many people. Including myself. I've been trying to genuinely focus on some of the positive things that have come from all of this. For example, I've noticed people enjoy being around others more (direct family). I see more kids on my street, and their parents actually playing with them. I see all the different pets on my street that I never have before, and I realize how happy they are to be outside with their owners. I notice the grass is getting greener, and some trees are beginning to sprout their flowers. I notice more squirrels, bunnies, and birds.I have separated myself from the news as much as possible. I've distanced more from social media. And I've kept more in contact with my friends and family. I've begun practicing yoga, going on runs, and caring for my plants.What positive things have you noticed?

42,How much screen time?,https://covid19.camhx.ca/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=64,2020-04-07T15:33:53-04:00,Guitar Girl,"
I have a 4 year old and we have deliberately not exposed him to screens very much at all. He does not know how phones or iPads work.  He only started watching movies 3 weeks ago (we now do a family movie afternoon once per week).   On average, he watches about 15 minutes per day and this started back in November.  He is very articulate and communicates well with adults and children and is quite advanced for his age, verbally.  The problem now is, well...you all know what the problem now is.  I have meetings to attend and work to do.  He refuses to do any independent play and I don't get even 5 minutes to myself all day. He is an only child.My question is:  what have parents in a similar situation been doing about screen time during Covid-19?  I would love to hear how others' experiences of managing screen time during this stressful time.  Thank you.

Just a question. Wasn't sure where to turn onto ask..I see a psych doctor at Camh regularly  for counselling and meds. Since Covid has started I have not heard from them at all. I emailed once to reach out, but no response and with them being my only support I am feeling left behind and struggling. I heard a few people from programs I have been in that their doctors/workers have reached out to check on them and I am just wondering is this the norm? Are doctors emailing and calling to checking on patients? Or is this something not to expect? Are you all talking to your doctors or like me and left to fend alone? And if you are fending by yourself, how are you getting by? *people say to reach out to your supports, but it's hard when you have 1 friend and 1 doctor for support*

I feel like I can't escape the news or information about what is happening outside of my control. I'm trying to avoid getting depressed again but it's very hard. I'm using all of my MCBT techniques and it helps until I get the next news alert from a friend, family member, or google. How much information is healthy at this point?  I'm just really overwhelmed. I feel myself ruminating and I am not sure how to stay mentally healthy during this time. Am I not doing enough because I'm not baking, exercising, cooking, working, learning a language, painting, and learning an instrument? I just want to maintain the progress I've made.

I know a lot of people are trying to find cool and unique ways to occupy there time during the quaratine.  Our anniversary was coming up and we obviously couldn't do go out and celebrate so we decided to do something creative at home instead.We took some of lights from the holidays, old sheets, burlap string, some good ol' elbow grease, moved our bed infront of the TV and built ourselves a fort.  It was so much fun and exciting that it felt as if anything else we had planned wouldn't be able to top this.With that being said, we decided to keep things interesting by creating new and exciting ideas every Friday to have something to look forward to and at the same time make this period that much more memorable.If anyone else has any ideas please share because we'd love to hear them.

It can be really challenging to feel connected during times like this.

There has been much legitimate attention paid to the shortage of protective gear for medical and nursing staff.But  the people who clean those contaminated spaces where infected patients have worked or visited also cannot get protective gear. They are at risk every day and nobody has even noticed. Nobody is ordering a plane load of gear for them. One of them is my child and I fear for their life.  This person Works in a large site that houses numerous essential businesses and government offices.  And they can’t get  protective gear to clean any of those spaces, even  contaminated sites .  Unionized employees have the right to refuse this unsafe work, but ‘ management ‘ , maybe not. Quite frankly, without custodial staff in every space occupied by people, all of the containment  strategies we are currently using  fail, yet these people are on the  job with minimal or no protective gear every day.  This mum is scared and helpless!

I am having difficulties with trying to work from home full time and support my child in homeschool. My child needs extra support in general and I don't want them to fall behind as they were not doing very well in school before, either. They are very smart, but can't focus and requires alot of attention. We are working with doctors on a diagnosis, but in the meantime I need to do my work from home to get paid, and keep educating my child. I am doing 2 full time jobs at the same time. I am grateful for the income, but not handling the stress as well as I'd like, and want to support my child as much as possible. I also struggle with general anxiety and bipolar disorder.

I’m in a high state of anxiety about my 97-year old mother, who is in a nursing home in Dallas, Texas, thousands of miles from me (I live in Toronto). My sister, who lives in Dallas, was a daily visitor until the COVID-19 precautions were put in place, and I have been making regular trips to Dallas for many years now. (I had to cancel the flights I had booked for this month’s visit.) In this new world we’re in, my sister and I are completely cut off from our mother except for telephone calls (on which she can’t hear us) during which she expresses her astonishment at the scale of this crisis and her fear that she’ll never see us again before she dies. It’s heartbreaking. I find myself crying all the time - I can’t stop thinking of her. I try to meditate, do mindfulness exercises, focus on my work, etc, but I’m still crying.

There have been so many changes in such a short time. I’m
trying to stay positive but it gets harder the longer time goes on. I have my
own things to deal with, but then I’m also feeling mentally drained from
trying to be caring for my friends and family who are being laid off work
and having anxiety about what they should and shouldn’t do to prevent getting
or spreading the virus. 
I’m finding that a few things are helping me, like: trying
to remind myself of the silver linings or the things I am grateful for,
connecting with friends through social media or texting, watching dog videos. I limit how much news I'm watching, and try to find videos that have nothing to do with what we are going through. The 30-60minutes of distraction have been such a relief. I’ve
had to stop clicking on COVID memes on social media too because I was feeling
so overwhelmed and sad. Now I click on cute animal posts or posts about my
favourite shows. Luckily Instagram is intuitive and now my feed is a bit better
for my mental health. I also try to get some sunshine (near a window, by the
door, or short walks) when I can.

How should I go about talking to loved ones
(especially older family members) about social distancing who seem to not be taking
it seriously? I want them to understand the importance of social distancing
while also being sensitive to their concerns. I think they understand that social
distancing means avoiding public spaces but what’s missing is that it also means
not going to visit a friend/invite people over.
