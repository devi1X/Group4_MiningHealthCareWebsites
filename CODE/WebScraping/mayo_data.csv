0,Phlegm in my throat and post nasal drip after Covid,https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/phlegm-in-my-throat-and-post-nasal-drip-after-covid/,danny2022 @danny2022,"Ever since I had covid in January of 2022 I recovered from the virus but I was left with a constant phlegm in the back of my throat and post nasal drip that will not go away.  The feeling of having mucus in the back of my throat actually gets worse when I try to get rid of it by coughing.  I have been given steroid inhalers, albuterol, allergy medication, but none of these work.  The mucus gets worse especially after I eat.  I've never felt like this before and it all started after covid. Can anybody relate to what I am going through?"
1,Anyone experienced post covid tingling near mouth area,https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/anyone-experienced-post-covid-tingling-near-mouth-area/,ihndz @ihndz,"I had covid in 2020 and again January 2023,  suddenly I started feeling weird, first it was a light numbness by my left lip like when you have dental work and the lip is waking up then it changed into a mild tingling sensation whenever I pass my hand gently
by my left jawline area, it's near my lower lip area on the left side only. I went to a neurologist yesterday, he prescribed a muscle relaxant to see if that will help and an MRI of my brain for next Tuesday to make sure everything is ok.  Im just curious if anyone experienced something similar after covid19. Thanks in advance "
2,Continued Post-Nasal Drip and Constant Mucus in Throat,https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/continued-post-nasal-drip-and-constant-mucus-in-throat/,adominic @adominic,"I was sick the last week or January/first week of February. Home Test-negative, rapid PCR-negative. All COVID symptoms and known prolonged exposure to infected individuals make me believe it was COVID. Since then, I have had a tremendously hard time dealing with post-nasal drip and mucus collecting in my throat. It is clear, sticky and almost impossible to remove from throat by coughing or clearing my throat. Flonase does nothing, allergy pills do nothing. Had anyone else had an issue like this post COVID? How long did it last? What did you do to cope?  Small problem in comparison to others that post here, I realize. "

4,Epstein-Barr Treatment for Long Covid?,https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/epstein-barr-treatment-for-long-covid/,snakexeyes @snakexeyes,"First, a little background: I'm 9 months in to Long Covid and just ended a treatment regimen designed by the InCellDx / Innovative Bioanalysis research group (Dr. Patterson et al).  After 4 months of many medications that produced no results and only decreased my quality of life with side effects, I'm calling it.  The only medication that improved my functioning was Ivermectin (which did so dramatically), but even that has plateaued for several months now. I'm now waiting until the end of October to be seen at Stanford's Post-Acute Covid Syndrome clinic and have little to no hope for that either.  "

Anybody seen any reputable studies or articles addressing this?  I’ll be asking my own doctor too.  Just don’t know what to do!"

I thought it might be shingles. There is great pain inside my body’s underarm. A swab sample was  taken  in the ER. The test turned out negative for shingles.

16,Difficulty Driving After COVID-19,https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/difficulty-driving-after-covid-19/,McNabb5 @dmorris24,"In 2021, I drove for miles on the highways for additional income using Lyft, GoPuff and GrubHub to provide extra cash for my family. January 2022, I tested positive for COVID-19 along with my family. I knew I shouldn't be driving while I was sick but I decided to drive to get essential medicine next door. As I was driving out of my apartment complex to go to the store I had a painful squeezing sensation in my left leg which traveled to my arm and chest. I thought I was dying so I stopped and I tried going to Urgent Care but I couldn't drive any further. I went home and waited even though I should of went to the Emergency Room. During my battle with COVID at home I would have episodes where I had difficulty breathing, fatigue, brain fog, fever, light headed, chest pain, nightmares at night and some loss of taste. COVID was the worst sickness I had experienced in my life. After I tested negative a lot of the symptoms went away but I still had difficulty breathing, palpitations and I couldn't drive for even 2 miles. I eventually went to the emergency room in February 2022 and learned my D Dimer was high but no blood clots in chest, lungs and a normal EKG. June 2022, I had a Pulmonary Function Test and learned I had intermittent asthma after my COVID-19 infection. I checked my heart as well with my cardiologist and all my tests were normal including a stress test. Fast forward to now, I still have trouble driving but it's not as terrible. There are some days I can drive for 2 hours and others only minutes. I can't find any patterns other than my symptoms are worst when I drive on the highway. I get shortness of breathe, tingling in my hands along with feet, squeezing in my legs, squeezing in arms, light headed, feeling of fainting and chest pain. I was told it's just anxiety and I've been to the ER many times but these symptoms are very real and terrifying. I thought I could overcome this and took a job as a Field Technician but I was fired because I had an episode on the highway where I had to go to Urgent Care. This is ruining my life because as of lately my recent job offers involve a lot of driving and I struggle to drive. It's extremely difficult to get a remote job as it's extremely competitive. I'm hoping for a desktop tech job nearby so I don't have to drive too far. I wanted to know if anyone else has experienced the same issues with driving after COVID-19? What did you find and how you've over came it?"
17,Reinfection and immune suppression on prednisone,https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/reinfection-and-immune-suppression-on-prednisone/,dawn76 @dawn76,"Hi, I couldn't find a thread on this but wasn't exhaustive. I have been recently diagnosed with long covid and waiting to see an infectious disease specialist. I tested positive February 8 but am now negative. This was my second covid infection, the first started in late July 2022 and it took a month to recover that time because of inflammation in my lungs (which responded to a steroid inhaler). This time I took Paxlovid and most of my symptoms resolved. However, I continue to experience substantial fatigue and recurring low grade fevers. I started prednisone last week and am on day 6. It didn't help as much as I hoped but I was planning to try working 2 days this week. I work mornings at a preschool. Today, 3 students and 1 teacher tested positive for covid. I know I might have some immunity to covid but I also read the prescription warnings for prednisone to stay away from people with infections. My school is mask optional and I will mask. I'm feeling like it might be too risky to go back to work this week. Does anyone have experience with reinfection and suppressed immunity on prednisone? Thank you!"

I have learned that trying to do too much exercise when I have felt better can lead to an energy crash. I think that the trick is to very gradually increase my exercise routine and to give myself a day or two of rest in between.  Twenty minutes of yoga, then rest, eating lunch or a snack and a short walk is what I am doing now.

She – and many since- have spoken about the relief we feel when a physician tells us this is a real thing.. To this day- I feel like so much of this is in my head- especially when my symptoms aren’t as severe. The shortness of breathe, the racing heart, the jumpiness, the ear- fullness. The chest and base of skull pain. I’m so fortunate that these symptoms aren’t keeping me bed ridden anymore- but that nagging inability to believe I’m not doing this to myself is hard to navigate. Why is that? Is it because symptoms are so weird? So hard to describe? We can look like we are fine? Not sure what I’m asking here- just wondering how others have dealt with this.

By February 24, I started to improve and thought that I was on the mend. But by Sunday, February 26 the symptoms returned with a vengeance (severe congestion, cough, fever, headache, fatigue).
I went to the sick clinic at my doctors office on Tuesday, February 28 and was seen by a nurse who said she didn’t think it was rebound and only a sinus infection. She put me on antibiotics. I felt unheard and unseen. It seems to me to be classic rebound, but it was as if she didn’t want to acknowledge it (maybe they didn’t want to report it?).
Isolation is recommended for 5 days following the first day of rebound, so I have treated it as a rebound to protect my husband who is diabetic.
Has anyone else experienced rebound with Paxlovid? Anyone end up with a sinus infection with COVID?

I am vaxxed to the max (5 shots all together, last booster was in November 2022), and I know that is no guarantee you won’t get COVID, but I was disappointed that it finally caught me. I had so many friends get it and had been exposed but never got it so I was feeling confident (cocky?) I would never get it.
I am 64 and in good health, teach an exercise class and eat a fairly healthy diet.
I guess I’m considered high risk by age, so my doc got me right on Paxlovid that evening that I was diagnosed. I was hopeful I would have a minor case and go right back to work in 5 days. That was 10 days ago.
While most symptoms have improved (cough is almost gone, no more high fever, small spurts of energy) I have a few persistent symptoms that are keeping me home from work. I still have a stuffy nose, fatigue, and can’t seem to go 24 hours without a low-grade fever (a requirement for me to return to work).
I feel very unproductive and frustrated. I love my job and want to return to work, but I fear this lingering fever could keep me home a lot longer.
I followed advice given to me by HR and (reluctantly) filed for protection under FMLA. Now I’m glad I did because I never expected to be out of work for more than a week.
I can do some work from home, but I work in a public facility and need to be there to fully do my job.

Supplements alone didn't indeed stop them but stopping to eat many food did reduce them significantly. I don't know if it will work in your own case but maybe worth trying. Fasting also reduce the vibrations. I basically eat meat, chicken, vegetables (greens, cauliflowers, broccoli, zuccini, fresh peppers, hot pepper, spices, seeds, etc.) and mostly shelled nuts (less processed) but other nuts and seeds as well and drink bone broth. No gluten, no diary, no lactose, no fruit. I avoid eating scratcy vegetables (no peas, potato, etc), no rice, grains, lentils or fruit except blueberries and alike. I lost about 3 kgs but feel better although muscle twitchings are happening more often. I opted to olive oil mostly. I avoid frying my food. Also no sugar, no desserts, no coffee (rarely), eggs (rarely), no herbal tea, no gluten free flour or packaged gluten-free food because they are processed and have rice and corn flour in them etc. Avoid flour in general. I prefer hot water with frech ginger, fresh lemon juice, cinnamon, cloves black pepper and turmenic powder. I make green vegetable soup with chicken, ginger, hot pepper, etc. mostly.  Be careful with the amount of lemon juice. I make my choices based on anti inflammatory and anti toxic approach as much as possible. I stopped using cosmetics like creams. I use natural soap. I opted for natural oils for my face and body which I use every day. I mix some oils and apply this on my body which seem to reduce or stop esp. nerve(?) pain on my low left side + my low back pain. I have been taking propolis powder and bee polen every day with water, vitamin B complex, a-lipoic acid (2 months), probiotics that are bile resistant (continous), – Vitamin C (could be with Rosehips & Citrus Bioflavonoids) – one table each gluten and lactose free. Also omega 3 (in triglyceride form, 2×1) OR krill oil (1×1). I have been taking probiotics for the last 7 months. I have been taking all others for the last 1,5-2 months. I have also used anti-parasitic medicine a few weeks ago and was on some anti-fungal medication for vaginal ph imbalance die to previous infections. I have a history of reoccuring UTIs and antibiotics didn't seem to work but make me feel worse. My immune seem to be weak. I try to avoid taking medicatios excepts some supplements as mentioned above. I will probably stopped alpha lipoic acid after finishing the box, and switch to a multivitamin and mineral after I finish vitamin B complex. I would particularly suggest to begin with a slow elimination of your diet and be patient. My approach again was to not eat too much and target healing the gut.  I know how desperate one can feel and hope this helps someone. Please be careful when applying, always observe how you feel. I guess one needs to stick to this strick diet to see results if one can tolerate it. Please let me know if you see any changes. I still have other symptoms but this approach helped with reducing the internal vibrations significantly. I will try to write my story maybe another day. Best wishes."
50,Post COVID: Anyone experiencing internal vibrations?,https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/internalvi-ratio-upon-waking/,sharho @sharho,"I have had long covid for over two years and a symptom began sporadically during the initial seven weeks that has worsened since a second covid experience. It began as a “flutter” in my chest upon waking, lasting 5 seconds or so. It is not painful just a new sensation I have never experienced. After getting covid again in February 2022, the internal vibrations have become full body and go on for forty seconds. It is always upon waking or falling asleep temporarily during meditation and waking again. Long Covid retired me from my profession and I am not under any stress.

And my overall mental processing is faster. I'm more verbal now. It's been a change that had endured for several weeks. I'm had no other changes in anything. Just this.
My experience is subjective and there's no way I can claim this supplement is the catalyst for improvement. It could have been an improvement just bc of time.  My results don't *prove*- but since there are no side effects or contraindications that I know of, I'm continuing to take this, along with several other supplements.

I developed severe acid reflux ( I have hashimotos which can also cause reflux and can also be triggered by EBV, and while I’ve had reflux it got much worse after covid)
I suspected I had SIBO and my doctor was willing to give me a two week trial of cipro. Because I also suspected the possibility of h pylori I took a dose of pepto bismol daily in addition to pre and probiotics.
This helped significantly with my reflux though I still had some minor issues.
I still suffered from extreme fatigue and muscle weakness, which is common with hashimotos but much worse after covid.
I decided to look into some Ayurvedic medicine and a week ago started ashwagandha and black seed oil. Both have amazing benefits and there’s a link between Long Covid and EBV, and EBV is considered a factor in hashimotos too.
I also added Maca and oil of oregano. Oil of oregano can help with EBV as well. Black seed oil has been shown to help with h pylori as well.
Since starting these my fatigue is greatly improved. My reflux is practically gone and I’m actually able to do squats ( two years ago I could do 300 squats a day but since Covid started ( I thought I had covid back in 2020 but negative tests) I couldn’t do ten squats without feeling like my legs would fall off.

102,Heel pain after COVID-19 vaccine,https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/heel-pain/,kneadmuscles53 @kneadmuscles53,"Five days before my first Covid 19 vaccine, after several hours of shopping and walking, I suddenly developed a bruised feeling under my right heel. Thinking it was from poorly fitting shoes, I next day switched to more padded and supportive shoes with a good arch support and gradually it began to subside. One hour after receiving my first vaccine shot, after sitting in my car all the hour, I stepped onto the parking lot to go shopping and felt the pain in my heel so strong that I couldn't walk! I sat down to stretch and massage my foot and then limped into the store to briefly shop. I lived very far away from any doctors, so wanted to stay close to the vaccine clinic for a while longer to make sure I had no serious side effects. For a few more days I researched causes of heel pain and called my doctor about it. I had guessed it was Plantar Fasciitis because the symptoms and relief from suggested therapies matched my own. My doctor suggested the vaccine caused inflammation and said to take tylenol if I needed it along with stretching, massage, icing and using arch supports. Two weeks after the second vaccine shot, along with intense self therapy, the pain is very gradually subsiding. It is very upsetting because I have never had any type of foot discomfort in my 72 years and some people in medical blogs said their intense discomfort wouldn't go away. Finally, yesterday I discovered wearing Nike Hyperdunk basketball sneakers with Heel the Pain inner soles completely eliminated the discomfort along with continuing the manual therapy. If it returns, I will visit my doctor. Is anyone else suffering from this condition and what is your story?"

In OTC readers I wore a +1.50 my eye doctor had told me not to buy anything stronger than a +1.75 until I seen him again the following year. About 6 months after having covid in a period of about 2 months my reading vision began rapidly deteriorating. I had to buy a +2.75 ! I went to my eye doctor and began explaining to him what happened & the first thing he asked me was if I'd had covid & if I was sick longer than a couple of weeks (I will sick for 4 months). He said it had happened with other patients. He dialated my eyes & checked them out & said he couldn't see any damage to my eyes. However, now it seems as if my fat away vision isn't exactly as it should be. It's only been 4 months since I went to the eye doctor but I'm thinking I may have to go back before April of 2023 for my next visit.

126,newly diagnosed complex migraine with aura post-covid,https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/newly-diagnosed-complex-migraine-with-aura-post-covid/,shan77 @shan77,"Hello – I had an exhaustive workup at Mayo last July after experiencing an episode that seemed like a TIA (transient ischemic attack).  The neurologist finally diagnosed complex migraine with aura.  I am 66 years old and had one more typical migraine when I was 20, and nothing since then.  Since that first episode, I have had four more, and each has varied slightly in nature but all have been quite disturbing in that I often have a period where I slur my words, and then the actual migraine is followed by 2-7 days of brain fog that is distressing.  My Mayo neurologist did not suggest any medication, but I did connect with a local neurologist who suggested I try Nurtec, which is taken at the first symptom and can work for my type of migraine.  Medicare does not pay for it.  I broke down and bought an 8-pack, at $100/pill, and keep one with me always.  Since getting the med, I did have one migraine but it was the middle of the night and I was so out of it that I didn't think to take the pill until I was well into the episode.   The pulmonologist did determine that I had had covid, due to signs he saw on my lung CT.  I have come to the conclusion that my sudden onset of migraine is connected to the covid.

A few days into having Covid I woke up in the middle of the night to a really weird swaying back and forth feeling in my head. I freaked out and say up quickly and once I opened my eyes and sat up it went away. I kinda ignored it and thought it could have been from NyQuil. That same feeling has happened post Covid every now and then. I think it could be vertigo but here is the weird part. It only happens at night when I’m waking up but it had happened on one occasion during the day when I laid down (I was having anxiety  during this episode). The feeling is sometimes stronger on some days than others but it’s always the swaying back and forth feeling. I’ve also noticed that I never feel dizzy it’s literally just a swaying feeling in my head and when I sit up/open my eyes the feeling goes away. I do feel kinda like my body is moving when I sit still like laying in bed, sitting in my car, etc. It also doesn’t happen every night, it’s very random and can last 3 nights in a row and then goes away for a week or two. When it comes there is also some nights when I sit up and it goes away but when I lay back down and close my eyes it comes back and nothing helps I just have to wait it out and keep sitting up. This makes me feel like it’s not Vertigo or BPPV because no maneuver I do makes it go away but I also don’t know a ton about vertigo. I went to a neurologist and he did an MRI and it came back normal and he tried to do an EEG but I literally freaked out and had to stop because I began having the swaying feeling during and it gave me a panic attack. I’ve been to about 7 Doctors and nobody has helped at all. They all say they don’t know what’s going on. This has caused me many sleepless nights and anxiety about going to sleep. I’m a 23 year old female student so this lack of sleep has really made my mental health become horrible. I’ve also been to an ENT recently and he also didn’t know what was going on. He said it didn’t match BPPV and gave me an exercise to try during an attack which also didn’t help at all. He also did a hearing and pressure test and said it looked good.

Pneumonia, acute kidney failure, acute respiratory failure & acute hypokalemia in Nov-Dec of 2021. To back up, I have had “Battles” with severe sepsis & septic shock off & on for the past 22 months & the etiology is still unknown! So after my last hospitalization in May, I noticed my hair was no longer falling out by the buckets after Covid; it was literally GONE within 5 days! I have been to every medical discipline known to man. They don’t know why I continue to get septic; but agree my hair loss is 100% due to long Covid. I guess I just assumed it was from the stress to my body from all 13 sepsis hospitalizations. About 8-10 weeks post Covid I had mild internal vibrations! Just brushed it off. Then they became more frequent, harder & lasting up to 2-3 hours. At first, I accused my friend of having a couch that vibrates. She looked at me like I’d lost my marbles & said “there is nothing vibrating”. Of course I insisted she come sit where I was & feel for herself… nothing. I said “well feel my arm”… she said “I don’t feel anything”. Then I stood up & said “Oh Sh…, the floor is vibrating really hard!” And again “NOPE”. I’ve been to a couple Dr.’s who have no idea why this is happening. I have an appointment with a Neurologist in Dec. & hopeful for some answers!  I’m so darn grateful I came across this website!! I’m shocked AND relieved that so many others suffer these vibrations. Mine happen more frequently when I lay down to sleep; but happen in addition to that at least 2-3 times during the day. When they are severe, I can’t walk around or drive. Mine are throughout my entire body. My feet & head are the worst. I feel my entire body jumping ; it amazes me that no one can see or feel them. My brain & teeth even feel like they are “trembling” ! Since I’ve gotten no answers, I’ve learned to just embrace it until someone comes up with a definitive DX &/or TX!! Now I just go lay in my bed & turn on my bed vibrator as high as it will go for as long as it takes! When my bed is vibrating, it makes my internal vibrations feel less apparent! I don’t venture out too far anymore because I’m a bit paranoid it will happen in public where there may not be a chair! I definitely lost my career probably indefinitely due to my health, which before sepsis was great! I have memory issues also; so working in a hospital caring for patients isn’t in the cards! In this journey of mine; I’ve had to rely on my new “motto” … “PAIN shapes a woman into a WARRIOR!”  And for the gal that I ran across also with hair loss issues; I share this with you: “You don’t need hair to wear your crown honey!” Peace & Love 💕 God Bless y’all, “May you find comfort from your afflictions through Jesus Christ our Lord & Savior”!!

I now have been suffering with anxiety which i have never had in my life along with terrible fatigue…I am always tired and if i do anything physical i breathe heavy.
My Meds doc at the TMS and mental health center wants me to see primary care doctor to rule out other issues.
He has switched me from viibryd to 200 mg of luvox at bed time for ocd ( ruminating thoughts)…I still take Klonopin 0.5mg at night and as needed otherwise for anxiety.
My anxiety can come up at anytime for no reason and no triggers.
He thinks i may have long covid and says he sees a couple long covid patients.
My question is…How do i approach my primary care doctor besides telling him the obvious?
If all my bloodwork and tests come back fine…Then what?
Who actually can diagnose you with long covid and how is it treated?
This cronic fatigue and anxiety has made life miserable and i am a shell of my once self.
I can function but only just enough to barely get by every day.

A few days into having Covid I woke up in the middle of the night to a really weird swaying back and forth feeling in my head. I freaked out and say up quickly and once I opened my eyes and sat up it went away. I kinda ignored it and thought it could have been from NyQuil. That same feeling has happened post Covid every now and then. I think it could be vertigo but here is the weird part. It only happens at night when I’m waking up but it had happened on occasion during the day when I’ve laid down (I was having anxiety in both of these occasions). The feeling is sometimes stronger on some days than others but it’s always the swaying  back and forth feeling. I’ve also noticed that I never feel dizzy it’s literally just a swaying feeling in my head and when I sit up/open my eyes the feeling goes away. I do feel kinda like my body is moving when I sit still like laying in bed, sitting in my car, etc. It also doesn’t happen every night, it’s very random and can last 3 nights in a row and then goes away for a week or two. When it comes there is also some nights when I sit up and it goes away but when I lay back down and close my eyes it comes back and nothing helps I just have to wait it out and keep sitting up. This makes me feel like it’s not Vertigo or BPPV because no maneuver I do makes it go away but I also don’t know a ton about vertigo. I went to a neurologist and he did an MRI and it came back normal and he tried to do an EEG but I literally freaked out and had to stop because I began having the swaying feeling during and it gave me a panic attack. I’ve been to about 7 Doctors and nobody has helped at all. They all say they don’t know what’s going on. This has caused me many sleepless nights and anxiety about going to sleep. I’m a 23 year old female student so this lack of sleep has really made my mental health become horrible. I have an appointment with an ENT but I’m so scared something bad is going on. "

it quit working…And since then i have been on numerous meds for worsening depression and now have anxiety attacks (Which i never had in my life)…I have cronic fatigue…If i do anything physical i get terribly sore for the next couple days afterwards..I get feelings of pins and needles in my shoulders and feet sometimes.
when i lay down i can feel my heart pounding…Sometimes i have trouble remembering things and feel foggy.
Currently i am in the middle of TMS therapy for treatment resistant

But i can help but wonder if my worsening depression and anxiety along with the other symptoms could be related to Long Covid?
I have no idea where to start?…Do i see my primary care doctor first?
I cant find any resources in my area or covid clinics etc etc.

Went back to my PC for a follow-up and he prescribed a 2nd round of steroids (12-day prednisone pack), along with an asthma inhaler. Within 48 hours of completing the steroids, started having SOB again, to the point it was a real chore to climb the stairs up to my bedroom. Had a follow-up with a pulmonologist on June 24th, and he sent me straight to the ER because he suspected blood clots – unfortunately he was correct (keep in mind, I had NO pain, swelling, redness in my legs, and no chest pain either, just shortness of breath – I was shocked). I spent another 6 days in the hospital and came home with blood thinners and home oxygen. After a follow-up stress test, they put me on high-dose prednisone and low-dose Bactrim (to prevent a ""super-bug"" infection) – so far I'm still on oxygen 24/7 (3-4 L, depending on exertion) and I started pulmonary rehab a couple of weeks ago. I can take the oxygen off for small periods of time if I am resting, but if I get up to do anything, my O2 sats drop to the low-mid 80's.

I’ve seen my PCP and a pulmonologist many times. Pulmonologists are so inundated these days and it’s very hard to get an appointment but I found one at UCSF in San Francisco a year or so ago who could see me. She just ordered a high resolution lung CT, which I’ve never had, as well as a specialized pulmonary function test because my last 2 were getting continually worse. The pulmonary function test is next week and the CT showed something very serious  that doesn’t show up on a regular chest CT, of which I’ve had many.  She diagnosed me with bronchiolitis obliterans (what a name!) and looking it up, it seems like it’s not that uncommon in post covid. I have mild to moderate air trapping in the small airways which explains why I can’t exhale all my air and I feel like I’m suffocating. My oxygen level is always fine. She’s going to wait to treat me until after the pulmonary test. I also somehow caught Omicron about 6 weeks ago which exacerbated my shortness of breath amongst other long covid issues I have, especially fatigue. Anyway, just a heads up to anyone with continuing shortness of breath. Don’t give up and mention a high resolution lung CT to your Dr. "

Diagnosis, post-covid neuropathy. That was on 1/30. Then on 2/5, another visit to ER. This time by ambulance because I couldn’t function. My heart rate was very high, bad stomach cramps. Sweating and rapid breathing. I thought it was maybe a heart attack. A few hrs later, after several tests and imaging, diagnosed with pancolitis.
Fast forward 2 months later, I am still a mess. My HR increases when I stand. Will continue riding until I sit down, thus resulting in not being able to do much. Body burning often, mostly feet, shoulders and arms. And I have had a GI flare-up every 2 weeks or more. They usually last about an hour but last night it last 4 hrs!!! I lost 7 pounds overnight. Not healthy.
I just completed wearing a heart monitor for 14 days., and had an ultrasound done. Will get results on 4/6. Finally got into a GI specialist a few days ago. Waiting on bloodwork and he scheduled me for a colonoscopy.

I had covid infection in April 2021. Before this infection i only had gerd , gastroenterological problems (abdominal distensions, bloating, flatulence) and  pharyngitis. 10 years ago i drank coke and i spit blood 2-3 times after stomacache and throatache. I did endoscopy then and i was diagnosed gerd. These gastroenterological problems cause excessive saliva. I was constantly spitting out my saliva. I also have benign fasciculations over 20 years especially when i have flatulence. These were all of my disorders before i had covid-19 infection. I didn’t have any serious condition.
In April 2021 i had covid infection. And after ten days i got diagnosed covid positive, my tongue kind of loosened after i drink water,  i had need to relax (open) my mouth and stick my tongue out a little. And one other sympthom that occured during covid was involuntarily swallowing reflex (gulp reflex). By involuntary swallowing reflex (gulp reflex) i don’t mean hiccups. Like hiccups, these are also involuntary but these are like swallows and causing sleeping problems, this reflex was keeping me awake every five minutes. And it also occurs when i am awake. These sympthoms are still ongoing. I am experiencing these sympthoms for 11 months! First 5 days of covid the only abnormalities were palpitations and mild shortness of breath. These days passed kind of normal. But I suddenly lost weight (10 kilograms) just in one week after 10 days my covid test came positive. My oxygen saturation was ok during covid. It did not go below %94. I did not hospitalized during covid. There wasn’t any coughs or muscle-joint pain. But there were these problems next to gastroenterological problems like nausea, diarrea, loss of appetite and inflammation in my bowels. For example I was feeling like paralyzed when i was defecating during those weeks. I can not describe that feeling well but I guess there was neurologic involvement in temporal side. I was feeling dizzy. At that time I had diffusion brain MRI and there wasn’t any finding. Everything seemed normal. One month after i tested positive i got better. I still had some problems with breathing but x-ray images of my lungs were ok. There wasn’t serious pulmonary involvement. I got my appetite back. I could gain my weight back for a month. Involuntary swallowing reflex, need to relax my mouth, loosing my tongue etc. decreased for a while. They did not disappeared but they were not causing problems for a month (between May 15 and June 15)."

I have been adhering to strict heart rate control measures during all of my daily activities, and am seeing significant improvement in heart rate reduction during activity and significant improvement in fatigue in six weeks.
No drugs, or special food or anything, just an inexpensive heart rate tracker and chairs in every room in my house.
I have been a Long Hauler for 20 months and just recently started Occupational and Physical Therapy in January 2022. My occupational therapist suggested using a sit and rest technique when my heart rate reached 20-25 bpm more than my resting HR. So, I watch my heart rate on my phone tracker while doing any activity, and when my heart rate gets 20-25 bpm above my resting heart rate, I immediately sit down and do deep belly breathing until my heart rate lowers to 10 bpm above my resting heart rate. Then I get back up and continue doing the activity. If sitting and belly breathing does not lower my heart rate to 10 bpm above my resting heart rate within 3-4 minutes, then I lie down until the heart rate is settled. Then I get back up and start the task again. If I leave the house on an errand, I carry a small camp stool with me and use it in the store. It took two weeks to get myself trained to stick with it and be patient, but now six weeks later I have reduced my heart rate during the same activities by 65%. AND my fatigue is lessening too.
I have posted my heart rate reduction data on the Facebook group Simple Tools for Recovering Long Haulers. I will also upload the PDF here tomorrow when I am back online.

The kind that make you breathless and dizzy and unable to do much of anything. So instead of the scheduled therapy, today we focused on recovery only.
They recommend that recovery take place when you are lying flat on your back. Take in a deep breath, then without exhaling, take in as much additional air as you can. So a double breath. You should feel the expansion in your ribs. This will flood your lungs with oxygen. Then let the air out as slowly as you can. Again when you think you are done exhaling, try to force more out. Do this until you are feeling more clear headed and less dizzy. I did it for about 10 minutes. Then sit up very very slowly. And do the same thing sitting up for several more minutes.
My crashes usually last 2-10 days. We are going to try to reduce the amount of recovery time by doing these breathing exercises laying down repeatedly through out the day. I am going to try lying down and doing double breathes for 10 minutes every hour.
I will let you know how it goes."

I think its because ive told myself to expect the worse but truthfully i am in such disbelief, horror and i dont know how to make it stop.
my boyfriend of 18 yrs is in the hospital with covid. He was having trouble breathing so he was admitted to icu for 2 weeks. he can barely talk and i visualize him as the fighter or the strong man ive known him to be. hes gone from icu to the fourth floor where he has his own phone now but cant seem to remember my number and he seems to be sleeping when i call the nurses station when im almost in a panic because i cant see him, take care of him or just, I dont know, something better than the engagement of the now communication which seems like none.
ive read about covid recently and the affects as well as the during and after math. this is down right the worse and sure hes not in icu anymore but i dont think hes in the clear and he seems so far from any kind of clear by far. hes 44 and im trying to prepare myself if he doesnt make it but come on, im fooling myself. I dont know how ive kept it together. I wish someone would tell me hes not gonna die. thats not possible as each person is different.
I just want to know hes not gonna die. im not ready, not that anyone ever really is, to let him go.
please, i not only need support and need to be told this is not the end.

He said my lungs are okay, and the condition I have is throat/radiation related, and nothing at all to do with my past Covid illness in March 2020. He said I do not have COPD, or Emphysema. This whole ride has been a crazy one. Get this: I tested positive for long-term antibodies in February 2021. I assume that was indicative of having Covid back in March 2020, when the virulent cough broke 3 of my ribs, going on for months, then turning into constant thick mucus. In March 2021, I received both doses of the Pfizer vaccine. On April 4, I went to the local ER almost feeling horrible. I could barely walk two steps, was coughing up some wicked stuff, very sore throat, nausea, but the main thing was not being able to breathe. The hospital did a Covid test and it was negative. The ER doctor pumped me full of steroids, which helped my breathing…that and my Primetene Mist spray sold over the counter, thank God. It has literally saved my life. Thank you God for leading me to it. Anyway, I told the doctor I had an appointment with a Covid ""Long-hauler"" Pulmonologist the next day, and had to go early as it is approximately 100 miles away. He said he would have admitted me but because my daughter was driving me down, he sent me home with steroids. The next day my condition worsened, and after the appointment with the Covid savvy doctor (and his totally conflicting lung x-ray/CT Scan reading results of my other Pulmonologist that claims I have COPD and Emphysema) was sent via wheelchair to their ER, to await a bed for admission. He wanted ENT's to scope me to see my throat, plus could barely breathe or walk. This hospital also tested me for Covid, and guess what? It came back positive. Okay! Here I am, with long-term antibodies, both vaccinations, and have Covid again. People ask, how do you know it wasn't false? The way I felt. I have never had such an illness that just takes everything away from you, such as this. I will be out of quarantine in a few days here at home, and slowly tapering off a ten-day course of Dexamethasone 4 mg. 3-x-a-day. The ENT's informed me that my vocal cords were paralyzed and I needed a trach-tube put in. Well, I called my speech pathologist and local Pulmonary doctor. Both informed me that if my vocal cords were frozen, I would have no ""gag-reflex"" and would not be able to talk. I brought this up to one ENT, and one hour before the surgery was to be performed, another ENT came into my room and told me I should just go home and recover. He thought the whole incident was Covid-related, and nothing to do with my vocal cords. He was an angel I believe. If I could name this crazy incident of my life in a Twilight Zone episode, it would be called, ""Escape from the Unreal."" After spending 14 hours on a COT in the ER waiting for a bed, I was going to somehow try to leave, but knew my body would not comply because of the weakened state. Sorry to bore everyone, but thought you may want an update. So, yes, I am home-sweet-home for now. I sincerely hope everyone is well and fine. Please allow me to add one last thing!
Believe it or not, I found a children's product with homeopathic-type ingredients that actually works wonders for me at dissolving mucus. You can buy it cheap on eBay too! Mucinex, no matter what strength, does absolutely nothing for me, yet, this miracle liquid really works. I hope it works for all of you fellow mucus-sufferers as well!!! It's called ""Hyland's 4Kids Cold n Mucus Daytime"" Please give it a try…I just looked on eBay, and there are many great deals on the product.
In addition, I ordered a device that is due to arrive in a few days. It is very innovative, and took hours of searching to find it! You will need a suction machine to use this little miracle. It is called ""The No-Bite V,"" and is sold by ""NJR Medical. Here is a link: https://store.njrmedical.com/.

I wear one all the time and have not been in the hospital since 1/2019 and I think that is because I wear a mask.  Have any of you experienced  anything like this where your body rejects vaccines?

I was ready, excited and had no anxiety prior or at the appointment.  About 2-3 hours after, I had an unforeseen event that caused me severe anxiety, anger, fear  and panic that lasted at least 12 hours.  I read some information on the vaccine not being as effective for those who suffer from mental illness and chronic anxiety.  My question is about the efficacy and if the vaccine will still be as effective if I sent my body into the flight or flight response soon after the vaccine and lasting for many hours.  Did my body still respond the way it should and start building immunity?  I do suffer from anxiety and depression on occasion but this was severe. I was SO upset because I had done everything ""right"" to prepare my body and mind for this vaccine and now feel like I may not get the full benefit. "

In the past year, it’s astonishing to think that our medical professionals, scientists, and researchers have done absolutely amazing things! Almost immediately, researchers around the world were redirected from ongoing projects to Covid-19 projects. They isolated and gene-sequenced the virus with unprecedented speed. They have figured out how to manage the worst stages of the disease, with medications old and new, as well as basic medical care practices and many modifications of standard care. They have found ways we can safeguard ourselves and each other with masks, frequent handwashing, social distancing, isolation & quarantine. Most astonishing of all, multiple successful vaccines were developed and brought to market in less than 8 months! This is a task that usually takes at least 4 years – remember it took 23 years to develop the first polio vaccine. Enough vaccines need to be manufactured to cover two doses for about 333 million people in the US alone. That’s 666 million doses, distributed on time and safely. This is a colossal undertaking. And as we see now distribution is not perfect.

They obviously did not understand that masks alone are not enough. Masks help keep droplets away from you but they can only do so much. The force at which a sneeze or cough forces particles into the air if you are close to someone is not really enough to protect you. You have to be at a minimum of 6′ apart with a mask on to protect yourself. It isn’t 100% perfect but it’s better than either of them alone. And this is especially true if you are inside.

On the worst night I sat up struggling to breathe all night long which prompted an ER visit.I am seeking discussion and support here because my symptoms have not yet entirely subside after 8 weeks.The shortness of breathe improved slowly over two weeks. I am left with fatigue, dizziness with exertion at times and a racing heart usually every night followed by breaking out in a sweat and chest burning. These symptoms have been present since the shortness did breathe started and only slightly lessen with time. Just when I feel better I will have a rough night. This is how the symptoms have been all along.. a roller coaster.I have had the million dollar work up meaning general labs a ct of my chest an echo of my heart and even wore a heart monitor.My pulmonologist, cardiologist and PCP all have not much to say. Other than to rest.I have overall been very healthy and now find myself unable to get through the day with out lying down and am up many nights with a racing heart and sweats and recurrent mild sob even.I’m seeking to hear from medical professionals or individuals who find themselves with lingering symptoms. I’m not sure what to do next and am worried. I have young kids who I want to live for and my job after 8 weeks grows impatient with me to return to the field of caring with sick Covid patients."

My husband has been working every day because he's essential worker. I think he expects me to mostly stay at home except for shopping and exercise. But that's not satisfying for me. I don't feel like I am vulnerable so I want to be out doing stuff. I even checked with my doctor and I'm not in vulnerable population. So I signed up but I didn't tell my husband that I am volunteering at food shelf. It bothers me to not tell him.

I’m trying to get current information on when it is safe to move my son out of covid 19 quarantine and bring him home to St. Paul. He is currently in San Jose on a college internship. He was advised to self quarantine 4 weeks ago as he had sore throat, dry cough, and mild chest pain. He did not have and has not had a fever. He did not qualify to get a test for the virus. We were advised to wait until ALL symptoms cleared completely before transporting him. I intend to do so by car, rather than a flight home. It is incredibly hard to get an answer on what is safe – for him and others. Chest pain and dry cough have resolved, sore throat has improved but has not resolved. CDC now says only fever has to resolve (for 3 days sans meds) and upper respiratory symptoms improve (not resolve) provided first symptoms started more than 7 days previously before it is safe to come out of isolation. Unfortunately, not certain if this change in recommendation is science-based or politically influenced by the white house. Want to find legitimate, science-based medical recommendations as well as any recommendations for safe transport – do I need to mask up my son or myself as I transport him?"

Those which have not yet will surely do so in the near future. This is certainly a prudent reaction, both to protect vulnerable populations, and to allow our health care providers to focus on patient care.The downside, of course, is that isolation itself is creating a risk to the well-being of those who rely on visitors for connection to the outside world, and for help with day-to-day tasks that staff is often unable to provide. A further complication is that, in most facilities, communal activities and meals are also suspended to reduce contagion, so our loved ones are even more isolated.One obvious suggestion, of course, is to communicate by phone, or if the patient is able by video chat. Another is to send cards and short notes often.The harder question is how to provide stimulation and assistance. For example, for years my sister and I did laundry, paid bills, generally straightened up for our Mom – I don’t know who would have done it if we couldn’t go in – certainly staff are already stretched to the max. I have reached out to my daughters – both RN’s, one with 10 years of elder care experience, one in hospitals – for their ideasWhat ideas or suggestions do any of you have?
